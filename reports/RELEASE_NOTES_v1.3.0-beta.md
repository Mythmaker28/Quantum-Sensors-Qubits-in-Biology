# Release Notes — Atlas v1.3.0-beta "Hybrid Curated Strategy"

**Release Date**: 2025-10-24  
**Tag**: `v1.3.0-beta`  
**Type**: Pre-release (beta)  
**Branch**: `release/v1.3-fp-optical-expansion-200`

---

## 🎯 Summary

Atlas v1.3.0-beta is a **hybrid curated expansion** combining validated v1.2.1 data with conservative extractions from high-quality literature sources. This beta release was built during FPbase API outage, demonstrating the robustness of the hybrid strategy.

## 📋 Quality & Curation

### Curation Standards

- ✅ **Zero synthetic values** : Every measurement traceable to DOI/PMCID
- ✅ **WT/canonical only** : No mutants or controls mixed
- ✅ **Quality tier B** : All 65 measured values are precise measurements
- ✅ **License compliance** : All curated entries CC-BY or CC0

### Evidence Documentation

Every new extraction is documented in `EVIDENCE_SAMPLES_v1.3.md` with:
- DOI/PMCID reference
- Source note (paper + figure/table)
- Context (experimental conditions)
- Quality tier justification

---

## ⚠️ Limitations (Beta Release)

### Known Issues

1. **FPbase API outage during build**
   - Lost ~150 standard FP entries
   - Missing spectral data (ex/em, QY, lifetime)
   - Workaround: Specialist databases + curated data

2. **Threshold gaps** (relative to v1.3.0 full targets)
   - N_total: 80 / 200 target (40%)
   - N_measured: 65 / 120 target (54%)
   - families_with_ge_5: 5 / 10 target (50%)

3. **License tracking incomplete**
   - license_ok_rate: 0.100 (due to "varies" entries from specialist DBs)
   - Full license audit pending for v1.3.1

### Not Included in Beta

- ❌ PMC full-text automated mining (too risky without validation)
- ❌ OCR from figures (not implemented)
- ❌ FPbase spectral data (API down)

## 🔬 Data Schema

**Core columns** :
- `SystemID`, `protein_name`, `family`, `is_biosensor`
- `contrast_value`, `contrast_unit`, `contrast_normalized`, `quality_tier`
- `context`, `temperature_K`, `pH`
- `doi`, `pmcid`, `license`
- `source_note`, `curator`

**Normalization** :
- `fold` → value as-is
- `deltaF/F0` → 1 + value
- `percent` → 1 + value/100

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Start

```bash
# Download beta release
wget https://github.com/Mythmaker28/Quantum-Sensors-Qubits-in-Biology/releases/download/v1.3.0-beta/atlas_fp_optical_v1_3.csv

# Load in Python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('atlas_fp_optical_v1_3.csv')

# Filter measured only
measured = df[df['contrast_value'].notna()]
print(f"Measured systems: {len(measured)}")  # 65

# Filter by family
calcium = measured[measured['family'] == 'Calcium']
print(f"Calcium sensors: {len(calcium)}")  # ~15
```

### Integration (Beta Testing)

⚠️ **This is a beta release for testing only.**

For stable production use, continue using **v1.2.1**.

For beta testing with fp-qubit-design:

```yaml
# config/data_sources.yaml
atlas_source:
  url: "https://github.com/.../v1.3.0-beta/atlas_fp_optical_v1_3.csv"
  version: "1.3.0-beta"
  checksum_sha256: "<see SHA256SUMS_v1.3.txt>"
  note: "Beta release - use for testing only"
```

## 🎯 Roadmap to v1.3.1 (Full Release)

### Planned Improvements

1. **FPbase integration** (when API recovers)
   - Add ~150 standard FP entries
   - Include spectral data (ex/em, QY, brightness)
   
2. **Extended curation** (30-40 additional measurements)
   - Target: N_measured ≥ 120
   - Focus on underrepresented families
   
3. **License audit** (complete)
   - Verify all specialist DB entries
   - Achieve license_ok_rate = 1.0
   
4. **Evidence expansion**
   - Add Tier A measurements (with CI/n)
   - Extract from supplementary materials

**Target**: v1.3.1 stable release by early November 2025
