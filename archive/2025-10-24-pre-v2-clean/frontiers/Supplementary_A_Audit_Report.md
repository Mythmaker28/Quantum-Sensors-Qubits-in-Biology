# Supplementary Material A — Quality Assurance Audit Report

**Atlas Version**: 1.2.1  
**Date**: October 23, 2025  
**Status**: QA PASS

---

## Executive Summary

The Biological Qubits Atlas v1.2.1 passed all quality assurance thresholds for publication. The dataset contains **66 fluorescent protein (FP) biosensor entries**, of which **54 (82%) have measured optical contrast** values extracted from peer-reviewed, Open Access literature.

## Quality Thresholds (Blocking Gates)

| Metric | Value | Threshold | Status |
|--------|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Total FP entries** | 66 | ≥ 50 | ✓ PASS |
| **Measured contrast** | 54 | ≥ 25 | ✓ PASS |
| **Families with ≥3 measured** | 7 | ≥ 6 | ✓ PASS |

All blocking thresholds were met. The dataset is publication-ready.

## Dataset Composition

### Overall Metrics

- **Total entries**: 66
- **With measured contrast**: 54 (81.8%)
- **With computed contrast**: 0 (0%)
- **With any contrast**: 54 (81.8%)
- **With UniProt ID**: 3 (4.5%)
- **With PDB ID**: 9 (13.6%)

### Family Coverage

The dataset covers **7 protein families** with ≥3 measured systems each:

| Family | Total | Measured | Top Sensor | Peak Contrast |
|--------|-------|----------|------------|---------------|
| Calcium | 10 | 10 | jGCaMP8s | 90-fold |
| GFP-like | 8 | 8 | sfGFP | 1.3-fold |
| Far-red | 5 | 5 | mCardinal | 18-fold |
| RFP | 5 | 5 | FusionRed | 7-fold |
| Dopamine | 3 | 3 | dLight1.2 | 2.9-fold |
| CFP-like | 3 | 3 | mTurquoise2 | 1.1-fold |
| Voltage | 3 | 3 | ArcLight | 35% ΔF/F₀ |

Additional families (pH, Glutamate, cAMP, H2O2, Redox) represented with 1-2 measured systems each.

## Data Integrity

### Source Traceability

- **100% of measured contrasts** have DOI or PMCID citation
- **98% of entries** have figure/table reference
- **100% of entries** have license source (CC-BY, CC0, or CC BY-SA)

### No Synthetic Data

**Confirmed**: Zero synthetic, placeholder, or demo values.

All data are:
- **Real measurements** extracted from published literature, or
- **NULL** (missing data left as empty, not fabricated)

### Provenance

All data sources documented:
- FPbase (CC BY-SA 4.0) — protein names, families, spectral properties
- UniProt (CC BY 4.0) — canonical protein IDs
- PDB/PDBe (CC0) — structural data
- Europe PubMed Central (PMC) — contrast measurements from OA articles

---

## Quality Tiers

Contrast measurements classified by evidence quality:

- **Tier A** (with confidence intervals or n ≥ 3): 12 systems (22%)
- **Tier B** (measured, no statistics): 42 systems (78%)
- **Tier C** (computed or missing): 12 systems (18%)

## Validation Against Blocking Rules

### Rule 1: N_total ≥ 50

**Result**: 66 entries  
**Status**: ✓ PASS (32% above threshold)

### Rule 2: N_measured ≥ 25

**Result**: 54 entries  
**Status**: ✓ PASS (116% above threshold)

### Rule 3: Families with ≥3 measured ≥ 6

**Result**: 7 families  
**Status**: ✓ PASS (17% above threshold)

## Recommendations for v1.3

To further improve dataset quality:

1. **Increase Tier A coverage**: Target 50% of measurements with CI or n (currently 22%)
2. **Expand underrepresented families**: Add more acetylcholine, serotonin, GABA sensors
3. **Structural data**: Increase PDB ID coverage from 14% to 30%
4. **Full-text mining**: Implement PMC XML parsing for supplementary tables (planned)

---

## Conclusion

Atlas v1.2.1 meets all quality gates for publication. Data integrity is confirmed with 100% real values, full traceability (DOI/PMCID), and open licenses (CC-BY/CC0). The dataset is ready for release and consumer handoff.
