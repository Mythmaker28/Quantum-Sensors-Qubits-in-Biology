SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL A - QUALITY ASSURANCE AUDIT REPORT

Atlas Version: 1.2.1
Date: October 23, 2025
Status: QA PASS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Biological Qubits Atlas v1.2.1 passed all quality assurance thresholds for publication. The dataset contains 66 fluorescent protein (FP) biosensor entries, of which 54 (82%) have measured optical contrast values extracted from peer-reviewed, Open Access literature.

QUALITY THRESHOLDS (Blocking Gates)
Metric                    Value    Threshold    Status
Total FP entries         66       >= 50        PASS
Measured contrast        54       >= 25        PASS
Families with >=3       7        >= 6         PASS

DATASET COMPOSITION

Voltage     3      3         ArcLight      35% ΔF/F₀

DATA INTEGRITY
- 100% of measured contrasts have DOI or PMCID citation
- 98% of entries have figure/table reference
- 100% of entries have license source (CC-BY, CC0, or CC BY-SA)
- No synthetic data: Zero synthetic, placeholder, or demo values

CONCLUSION
Atlas v1.2.1 meets all quality gates for publication. Data integrity is confirmed with 100% real values, full traceability (DOI/PMCID), and open licenses (CC-BY/CC0). The dataset is ready for release and consumer handoff.
