countless proteins and molecules that are
constantly changing in response to extra- and intracellular cues.
The interactions between cells within a tissue add layers of complexity
to the signaling networks maintaining a dynamic equilibrium between
and within cells. These heterogeneous signaling networks are organized
and regulated across multiple spatial and temporal scales, intensifying
their complexity. Dissecting the signaling activities that underlie
cellular functions in healthy and diseased states is crucial to expanding
our knowledge and understanding of cellular biology.</p><p>Our knowledge
of cellular biology has been shaped by a multitude
of technical advances over the last several decades. Many landmark
discoveries were achieved using powerful biochemical and sequencing
technologies that capture detailed snapshots of cellular events. But
as our appreciation of the inherently dynamic and heterogeneous nature
of cellular behavior has grown, so has the need for more sophisticated
tools capable of precisely monitoring the intricate molecular dance
occurring within and between cells. With the discovery of fluorescent
proteins, a completely new field emerged which enabled researchers
to visualize the real-time dynamics of various analytes, macromolecules,
and biochemical activities with spatiotemporal precision in single
living cells. The subsequent expansive engineering efforts targeting
fluorescent proteins have yielded a vast suite of labeling and biosensing
tools that enrich our understanding of the complex systems at work
within cells, leveraging the power of live-cell fluorescence microscopy
methods to offer deeper insights than previously achievable.</p><p>With this review, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of
fluorescent biosensors (the term biosensor is used throughout this
review interchangeably with the terms sensor, reporter, probe, and
indicator) and their utility as engineered tools to probe cellular
biology, with an emphasis on cutting-edge applications and emerging
areas of improvement and research. We start with a description of
the properties of fluorescent proteins which have been engineered
to enhance their utility as molecular tools. Reflecting the evolution
of the field, the design of fluorescent protein-based labels and biosensors
as well as their corresponding applications with increasingly innovative
strategies are discussed. Briefly, we describe applications of fluorescent
proteins as smart labels, which involve harnessing the intrinsic properties
of various fluorescent proteins to observe the behavior of a molecular
target. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of the design
and use of genetically encoded, fluorescent protein-based biosensors
(for a comprehensive list, visit <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://biosensordb.ucsd.edu/">biosensordb.ucsd.edu</uri>),
which are engineered molecular tools whose fluorescence properties
alter in response to the detection of distinct molecular species or
biochemical activities, thereby allowing us to monitor signaling dynamics
in living cells. Notable biological findings obtained using these
tools are also highlighted. Finally, avenues and opportunities for
enhancing available tools and addressing gaps in the field are discussed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Passive Sensors Go Smart</title><p>For the initial
discovery of <italic>Aequorea victoria</italic> green fluorescent
protein (GFP) in 1962, the groundbreaking demonstration
of GFP as a genetically encoded fluorescent label in 1994,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> and the subsequent molecular engineering of GFP variants, Drs. Osamu
Shimomura, Martin Chalfie, and Roger Y. Tsien were awarded the 2008
Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Since then, numerous fluorescent proteins
(FPs) with distinct properties have been derived from this initial
template. The discovery of new FPs from diverse marine organisms has
further expanded the palette available for modification. In the simplest
application, an FP is fused to a protein of interest (POI) as a passive
label that allows us to visualize the presence and location of the
tagged POI within a cell. In this way, the intrinsic fluorescence
of an FP is visualized and tracked to infer certain behaviors of the
tagged POI with high spatial and temporal resolution. While such passive
sensors were originally conceived to monitor protein expression, mobility,
or localization in live cells, their utility has been greatly extended
with the engineering of scores of FPs that exhibit a diverse range
of spectral and photochemical properties, including brightness, color,
and photostability (a glossary of FP-related terms can be found on
FPbase, <uri xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="https://help.fpbase.org/glossary">https://help.fpbase.org/glossary</uri>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref></sup> The novel properties of these engineered
FPs are readily manipulated in the experimental setting, thus allowing
FPs to also serve as smart labels, to gain deeper insights into the
behaviors of labeled proteins. Below, we provide a brief overview
of the various properties that have been engineered to increase the
utility of FPs and drive the development of the molecular tools discussed
throughout this review. Specific applications of FPs as passive and
smart labels, and the fascinating biological insights they have provided,
are also highlighted.</p><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Properties of Fluorescent Proteins</title><p>A combination of structural, chemical, and biophysical features allows
FPs to efficiently absorb and emit light. By carefully and systematically
studying FP behavior, researchers have been able to harness and manipulate
these features to engineer myriad FP variants with distinct functional
properties. In this section, we introduce the diverse spectral, photophysical,
photochromic, chemical, and structural properties that characterize
the FP toolkit.</p><sec id="sec2.1.1"><label>2.1.1</label><title>Spectral Properties</title><p>GFP and related
FPs form their chromophore through a post-translational covalent reaction
among amino acids 65, 66, and 67 (numbered according to <italic>Aequorea
victoria</italic> GFP), which confer fluorescence to the protein without
requiring additional cofactors or enzymes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> This chromophore is surrounded by a &#x003b2;-barrel consisting of
11 strands. The residues neighboring the chromophore and those that
are enclosed within the &#x003b2;-barrel are crucial to defining the
chromophore environment, which in turn affects the fluorescent properties
of the FP. For instance, molecular oxygen is required for chromophore
formation, and so a hypoxic environment can hinder FP fluorescence.
The chromophore environment of an FP can also shield it from external
factors that can quench fluorescence of the chromophore.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup> Residues within the chromophore environment can also participate
in a hydrogen bond network that stabilizes the chromophore and can
impact FP emission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup> Mutation of chromophore residues
in GFP, which peaks in emission at 509 nm, have enabled researchers
to spectrally tune the FP fluorescence, yielding blue (440&#x02013;470
nm emission), cyan (470&#x02013;500 nm emission), and yellow (510&#x02013;540
nm emission) FPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup> However, the discovery
of other naturally occurring FPs, such as the red FP DsRed from <italic>Discosoma</italic> coral,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup> which peaks
in fluorescence emission at 583 nm, was necessary for the generation
of FPs spanning a rainbow of colors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup> Recent
efforts to diversify FP spectral properties have focused on shifting
FP excitation and emission spectra to far red-, with emission between
640&#x02013;700 nm, or near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths, with emission
at &#x0003e;700 nm, to both minimize spectral overlap with existing FPs
and
enhance light penetration in living tissue, thus enabling greater
compatibility with multiplexed and <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging
applications. Some far-red FPs, such as TagRFP657<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup> and TagRFP658,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup> were derived
from the GFP-like eqFP578 protein from the sea anemonae <italic>Entacmaea
quadricolor</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup> The characterization
of bacterial phytochromes (BphPs), which require an extrinsic chromophore<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup> (discussed further in <xref rid="sec2.1.6" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec2.1.6" ref-type="other">2.1.6</xref></xref>), enabled the further expansion of NIR-FPs.</p><p>While maximizing spectral separation is often desirable, the availability
of spectrally diverse FPs also enables tagging approaches that take
advantage of overlap between color variants. Notably, when the emission
spectrum of one FP overlaps sufficiently (&#x0003e;30%) with the absorption
spectrum of another FP, the two can engage in F&#x000f6;rster (or fluorescence)
resonance energy transfer (FRET) where excited-state energy is transferred
from the first FP (donor) to the second FP (acceptor). Energy transfer
occurs nonradiatively via dipole&#x02013;dipole interactions and is
thus exquisitely sensitive to the proximity and orientation of the
donor and acceptor fluorophores, as summarized in the following equation<disp-formula id="ueq1"><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="cr4c00293_m001" position="anchor"/></disp-formula>where <italic>E</italic> is FRET efficiency, <italic>r</italic> is the distance between the donor and acceptor, and <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> is the distance at which a given donor/acceptor
pair exhibits half-maximal FRET efficiency (also known as the F&#x000f6;rster
distance). The value of <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> accounts for
factors such as the spatial orientation of the donor and acceptor
dipoles, as well as their spectral overlap, and is characteristic
to each unique donor/acceptor pair. Importantly, FRET occurs at scales
of 10&#x02013;100 &#x000c5; (1&#x02013;10 nm), making it a powerful molecular
ruler.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> This distance-dependence has inspired the
use of FRET-compatible FP pairs for multiple applications, most notably
to visualize and monitor protein&#x02013;protein interactions (PPIs)
and to generate genetically encoded biosensors, as detailed later
on in this review.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.1.2"><label>2.1.2</label><title>Photophysical Properties</title><p>Beyond
simply expanding the color palette of available FPs by tuning their
excitation/emission spectra, FP engineering can influence an array
of photochemical properties, including chromophore maturation, brightness,
and photostability, to suit different applications. Chromophore maturation
denotes the time required for the FP chromophore to covalently form
and become capable of fluorescence emission. Chromophore maturation
requires molecular oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), and mutations that alter
chromophore structure and its accessibility to O<sub>2</sub> via changes
to the chromophore environment can therefore affect maturation times.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> Maturation time is a key factor for optimizing the use of FPs in
the live-cell context. Maturation half-times of 40 min to 1&#x02013;2
h are suitable for passive labeling applications. However, faster
maturation may be necessary in specific applications, such as to detect
early promoter activation or to label proteins with rapid turnover.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref></sup></p><p>Timer FPs are a category of FPs that exploit
the process of chromophore maturation resulting in time-dependent
altered spectral properties. Timer FPs spontaneously change their
emission spectra over certain periods of time. For instance, DsRed-E5
initially matures into a green-emitting species but spontaneously
converts to a red-emitting species over time, independent of protein
concentration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref></sup> This allows for labeling
targets with a timer of expression. Building on DsRed, mCherry fluorescent
timers were developed that change from blue to red emission.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Three mCherry timers were generated that undergo
fast, medium, and slow color conversion (half times of 3.9, 7.1, and
28 h respectively). Timer FPs are thus useful labels that indicate
time in the live-cell context.</p><p>A major property that defines
FP performance across diverse contexts
is brightness, which has been a distinct focus of the field when generating
new FPs. The intrinsic brightness of an FP is the product of its extinction
coefficient and fluorescence quantum yield. The extinction coefficient
summarizes how efficiently light of a certain wavelength is absorbed
by the FP chromophore, whereas quantum yield relates how efficiently
the chromophore converts absorbed light into emitted light (i.e.,
fluorescence).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> These two properties can
be tuned by introducing mutations that may affect the chromophore
structure or molecular brightness of the FP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> Of note, the quantum yields reported for FPs are typically averaged
over bright and dark FP states.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> Haarscboch et al. reported that
the bright-state quantum yields of several red FPs were higher than
previously reported, due to the inclusion of the dark states in past
measurements, which made up a considerable fraction of the total FPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> Other factors can also affect the apparent brightness
of FPs in the experimental context, such as in live cells. For instance,
a recent approach to developing brighter FPs aimed to improve the
folding efficiency of EGFP to allow better solubility in the live-cell
context and thereby enhance brightness. These efforts resulted in
the generation of mGreenLantern, a green-emitting FP with 6-fold brighter
fluorescence emission than EGFP, but similar quantum yield.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref></sup></p><p>Photostability is another important consideration,
as frequent
or high-intensity exposure to excitation light can lead to photobleaching,
or a loss of fluorescence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> Often, there
is a trade-off between FP brightness and photostability, as alterations
to the chromophore that increase brightness can inversely affect chromophore
decomposition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref></sup> Achieving high brightness and
photostability has therefore been a goal of the field. The expansion
of fast-maturing, bright, and high-quantum-yield FPs, like mScarlet3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> or StayGold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref></sup> and
its variants (mStayGold<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> and mBaojin<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup>), will be integral to furthering the development
of FP-based tools that are improved in quality and performance.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.1.3"><label>2.1.3</label><title>Photochromism</title><p>Photochromism refers
to the ability of a chromophore to switch between two forms upon irradiation,
either reversibly or irreversibly.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> On
a molecular level, altered conformation of the methylene bridge between
two rings of the FP chromophore (cis&#x02013;trans or trans&#x02013;cis
isomerization) can lead to photoswitching.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> Residues around the chromophore are responsible for stabilizing
one conformation over the other and may contribute to the isomerization
process as well. Photochromism has been exploited in the development
of FPs that exhibit changing spectral properties upon exposure to
light of different wavelengths, such as Dronpa and UnaG. FP photochromism
can manifest as photoactivation, photoconversion, or photoswitching
depending on how the chromophore is affected by light.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> Photoactivatable FPs increase in fluorescence
upon exposure to a certain wavelength of light, and photoconvertible
FPs change their emission wavelength (i.e., color) upon exposure to
a specific wavelength of light. Photoswitchable FPs, on the other
hand, reversibly switch between emitting (bright or &#x0201c;on&#x0201d;)
or nonemitting (dark or &#x0201c;off&#x0201d;) states upon exposure
to specific wavelengths of light. These photochromic behaviors have
been integral to the application of FPs in super-resolution microscopy
techniques.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup></p><p>Advances in super-resolution
microscopy techniques, for which Drs. Eric Betzig, Stefan W. Hell,
and William E. Moerner were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in
2014, have coevolved with new FPs to enable fluorescence imaging past
the diffraction limit. Many of these techniques exploit photochromic
FPs, such as those that undergo photoactivation, to achieve super-resolution
imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> Briefly, super-resolution fluorescence
microscopy relies upon photostable and bright FPs due to the high
illumination intensity often required for these techniques. Reversibly
photoswitchable FPs, such as Dronpa, mEos, or the newer monomeric
Skylan-NS,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> have proven indispensable
for many super-resolution imaging techniques, as these FPs allow for
lower illumination intensity while still achieving super-resolution
by taking advantage of the distinct fluorescent states of these FPs.
Two revolutionary methods for improving the resolution of fluorescence
microscopy have laid the groundwork for many newer super-resolution
microscopy techniques: patterned illumination, such as stimulated
emission depletion (STED), and single molecule localization microscopy
(SMLM).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> For SMLM-based techniques in
particular, photoactivatable or photoswitchable FPs are crucial for
achieving live-cell imaging, as this method relies on image reconstruction
based on photoswitching of the fluorophore. For instance, SOFI, or
stochastic optical fluctuation imaging, was developed to take advantage
of spontaneous blinking of some fluorophores to reconstruct super-resolution
images.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> PALM, or photoactivated localization
microscopy, is another method that localizes single fluorophores by
inducing rounds of fluorescence activation in a densely labeled region
of the cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> Such techniques have enabled

and biomolecular imaging in live cells.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.1.4"><label>2.1.4</label><title>Chemical Properties</title><p>FPs have been
further engineered to achieve variable chemical properties. One major
adjustment to an intrinsic property of FPs was the development of
monomeric FPs, as many FPs tend to dimerize or oligomerize. For instance,
DsRed exhibits strong oligomerization and exists as an obligate tetramer <italic>in vitro</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref></sup> which greatly hinders
its biological utility. The development of a monomeric red fluorescent
protein (mRFP1)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref></sup> derived from DsRed greatly
enhanced the biological application of red FPs. Monomeric FPs are
useful for applications where protein aggregation may impact results,
such as when labeling dimeric or oligomeric targets. Many FPs also
exhibit sensitivity to environmental factors such as pH and temperature.
These properties have been exploited to develop sensors of pH or temperature
utilizing the inherent sensitivity of certain FPs to these conditions
(discussed in <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="other">4</xref></xref>). There are also consistent efforts to develop new FP variants with
reduced sensitivity to environmental factors. For instance, tdLanYFP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref></sup> is a new yellow-emitting FP that is significantly
less sensitive to pH than existing YFPs.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.1.5"><label>2.1.5</label><title>Structural Modification of FPs</title><p>In addition to tuning spectral, photophysical, and chemical properties
of FPs, several groups have introduced complex structural modifications
that broaden the applicability of FPs as tools to probe cellular biology.
One major example of this is the development of circularly permuted
FPs (cpFPs), which were first developed by the Tsien lab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref></sup> Baird and colleagues showed that linking the
original N- and C- termini using a short linker and introducing new
N- and C-termini within the seventh &#x003b2;-strand did not disrupt
GFP fluorescence. The resulting cpGFP could also be fused to proteins
of interest at various positions on the FP barrel, wherein conformational
changes in the protein of interest altered GFP fluorescence. Such
structural rearrangements resulted in the development of an FP that
can reflect changes in the fused protein of interest, serving as a
biochemical indicator. This inspired many cpFPs encompassing the spectral
rainbow<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref></sup> that have been incorporated in the development of
fluorescent biosensors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref></sup> some of which will be discussed later in this review.</p><p>Another important modification to FP structure has been the development
of split FPs for applications involving nonspontaneous fragment complementation.
In such systems, the FP is divided into two fragments that are individually
nonfluorescent and cannot reassemble on their own but will fully reconstitute
and gain fluorescence when brought into sufficient proximity. The
recovery of fluorescence therefore indicates an interaction between
the two components, making split FPs suitable for use in bimolecular
fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays to detect protein&#x02013;protein
interactions (PPIs) (discussed in <xref rid="sec2.2.2" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec2.2.2" ref-type="other">2.2.2</xref></xref>). Ghosh and colleagues first introduced
a nonspontaneously complementing FP system by splitting GFP into two
fragments, one comprising the first 158 residues, and the other comprising
residues 158&#x02013;238.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref></sup> When brought
into proximity by a pair of interacting proteins, the two GFP fragments
successfully reassembled, resulting in fluorescence (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>a). Similar nonspontaneously
complementing split FPs have since been developed that span most of
the visible spectrum,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">65</xref></sup> including the recent
development of an orange BiFC assay using the Kusabira-Orange FP,
mKO2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">66</xref></sup> Spontaneously complementing split
FPs are another example of a structural modification that expands
the utility of FPs. These FPs are engineered to split the FP &#x003b2;-barrel
between the 10th and 11th strands (N-terminal strands 1&#x02013;10,
C-terminal 11th strand) resulting in two nonfluorescent fragments
that can spontaneously reassemble into an intact FP<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">67</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">71</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>b). Because of their relatively efficient self-assembly, this
class of spontaneously complementing split FPs is usually used to
monitor protein expression, solubility, localization, or trafficking
in cells, rather than to report on PPIs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">70</xref></sup> Inspired by these designs, a tripartite fluorescence complementation
(TriFC) assay was developed to create a new nonspontaneously complementing
split FP system. For TriFC, GFP is split into three parts: &#x003b2;-strands
1&#x02013;9, 10, and 11. On their own, neither GFP<sub>10</sub> nor
GFP<sub>11</sub> spontaneously reconstitutes with GFP<sub>1&#x02013;9</sub>, but when the two strands are brought into molecular proximity by
interactions between their tagged POIs, they will recruit and reconstitute
with untagged GFP<sub>1&#x02013;9</sub>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref72">72</xref></sup> whereupon Glu222, in the GFP<sub>11</sub> strand, can catalyze chromophore
maturation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">73</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>c). The fluorescence signal of the TriFC
system was improved in 2020 by fusion of strand 11 to strands 1&#x02013;9
to generate a bipartite system that enhanced signal-to-noise ratio.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">74</xref></sup></p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Structural modifications of FPs. (a) In the split FP system,

fluorescent label rapidly
expanding in use. Chemigenetic labels include a self-labeling protein
that is nonfluorescent on its own but which can be labeled by a small-molecule
fluorophore to become fluorescent. The first example of a chemigenetic
label was introduced in 1998 by the Tsien lab, where 4&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-bis(1,3,2-dithioarsolan-2-yl)fluorescein
was used to label a tetracysteine domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref77">77</xref></sup> This was followed by several other chemigenetic labels, including
SNAP-tag,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref78">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref79">79</xref></sup> FAST,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref80">80</xref></sup> TMP/eDHFR
tag,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref81">81</xref></sup> and the broadly used Halo-tag.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref82">82</xref></sup> Compared to fluorescent proteins, chemigenetic
labels provide greater versatility. The self-labeling protein can
be made to fluoresce in different colors by using synthetic fluorophores
with variable spectral properties. These labels also overcome classical
limitations in FPs, such as low photostability, pH sensitivity, and
the oxygen requirement for chromophore maturation. Thus, chemigenetic
labels like Halo-tag are rapidly being adapted for use as labels and
in biosensors,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref83">83</xref></sup> although the details of
these applications are beyond the scope of this review.</p><p>Bioluminescence
has emerged as another light emission-based tool
for the study of cellular biology. Bioluminescent molecules emit light
through biochemical means, wherein a luciferase enzyme can oxidize
its luciferin substrate to achieve the excited state, resulting in
the emission of a photon upon return of the luciferin to its ground
state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref84">84</xref></sup> One of the first characterized
luciferases, Firefly luciferase, was isolated from bioluminescent
beetles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref85">85</xref></sup> Much like FPs, bioluminescent
molecules can undergo resonance energy transfer (bioluminescence resonance
energy transfer or BRET), which has been instrumental to their use
in biosensors. Unlike FPs, bioluminescent proteins do not need excitation
light to emit fluorescence. Thus, bioluminescent tools avoid phototoxicity
and autofluorescence, which are some limitations of fluorescence-based
tools. However, naturally occurring bioluminescent molecules tend
to exhibit much lower brightness than FPs. Mirroring the engineering
of FPs, brighter variants of luciferases and novel substrates occupying
different spectral spaces have been engineered. Improvements in stability
and signal in these systems have been achieved in part by the isolation
and mutagenesis of various luciferases from naturally occurring bioluminescent
species, such as NanoLuc from <italic>Oplophorus gracilirostris</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref86">86</xref>) and RLuc8 from <italic>Renilla reniformis</italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref87">87</xref>) with their respective luciferins. The

such engineering innovations have made FPs valuable
tools in the development and application of pioneering technologies.

Furthermore, the development of FPs with unique photochemical properties,
such as photoswitchable FPs, has directly contributed to the parallel
development of novel super-resolution imaging techniques that rely
on these unique FPs. Structural modifications to FPs, such as the
creation of split-FP systems, have served as the basis for tools to
detect PPIs. Finally, harnessing FRET between various FPs, as well
as the development of cpFPs, has been instrumental to the development
of a diverse array of genetically encoded biosensors to directly monitor
the dynamics of cellular signaling and biochemical pathways. Such
advances, which will be discussed in depth in upcoming sections of
this review, present numerous opportunities to expand the use of FPs
in high-impact translational and clinical applications.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Fluorescent Protein Labels for Monitoring
Molecular and Cellular Behavior</title><p>The earliest, simplest, and
still widest application for FPs is as passive labels tagged onto
POIs, where an FP essentially serves as a marker that reports on the
presence and location of the target protein. As FP properties were
manipulated and the palette diversified, they were exploited to accomplish
more complex tasks, becoming smart labels to power unique and innovative
applications that have brought to light diverse aspects of cellular
biology. In this section, we provide an overview of the many approaches
that harness FPs as passive and smart labels to probe biological phenomena
at various scales, from individual molecules up to whole animals.</p><sec id="sec2.2.1"><label>2.2.1</label><title>Labeling Proteins</title><p>An FP can be
tagged to the N- or C- terminus of a protein and visualized by fluorescence
microscopy to directly provide information on protein expression levels,
mobility, and subcellular localization. Fluorescence microscopy of
FP-fused proteins allows for the quantification of these properties
at the level of single cells, which accounts for cell-to-cell heterogeneity
as opposed to the population-level changes that are detected in biochemical
techniques such as Western blotting. When choosing an FP for a labeling
application, the color variant to be used is an important consideration.
Especially for labeling multiple different targets, FPs with minimal
spectral overlap must be used. Another significant consideration is
determining whether to attach an FP to the N- or C-terminus of the
POI. Although an FP tag can be viewed as functionally inert, its presence
may nevertheless physically occlude part(s) of the POI. Thus, it is
important to consider the structural and functional significance of
either terminus of the POI and how this might be impacted by a fused
FP. Incorporation of an extended flexible linker to serve as a buffer
between the FP and POI may help minimize such perturbations. Lastly,
overexpression of the POI may impact its native behavior. Therefore,
it is also crucial to choose an appropriate expression system and,
for sensitive contexts, to consider generating stable cell lines which
express the FP-fused POI at or near endogenous levels. A slightly
more sophisticated approach to FP labeling involves spontaneously
complementing split-FPs, consisting of separate FP strand 11 and FP
strands 1&#x02013;10 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>). Rather than fusing the full FP to the
POI, only FP<sub>11</sub> is attached, reducing the load on the POI.
The remaining strands (FP<sub>1&#x02013;10</sub>) are expressed separately
and will reconstitute with the FP<sub>11</sub>-tagged POI to yield
fluorescence and thereby enable visualization of the POI in live cells.
These various strategies and considerations for using FPs as labels
are crucial to optimizing experimental design.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Split-FP labeling for

involves fusing
an FP to a POI and then performing fluorescence imaging to quantify
relative changes in fluorescence intensity as a proxy for expression
changes over time. Endogenous changes in protein expression are regulated
at many levels, including at the level of gene expression, by intracellular
signals. Because overexpression of a fluorescently tagged POI using
an exogenous promoter can mask endogenous regulation of the POI, the
POI should ideally be endogenously tagged to an FP. A classic example
of this approach was presented by Elowitz and colleagues, who profiled
single-cell protein expression heterogeneity in <italic>Escherichia
coli</italic> using FP-fusions. This work revealed differences between
cells in the production of proteins as well as intrinsic sources of
noise, such as transcription rate and genetic factors, that contribute
to inter- and intracellular heterogeneity in protein expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref91">91</xref></sup> The use of FPs as labels can be taken a step
further to map the spatiotemporal complexity of cellular signaling
in live animals. For instance, NFkB signaling was mapped through <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of live mice expressing mEGFP-RelA or mScarlet-c-Rel,
representing the next step in labeling approaches to infer signaling
activity in living organisms with spatiotemporal resolution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref92">92</xref></sup></p><p>In addition to tracking expression, FP
labels can be used to track
protein mobility. An important element of tracking protein mobility
involves harnessing the photobleaching property of FPs. A method called
fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) is used for tracking
protein motility. In this technique, high-intensity illumination is
used to bleach FP fluorescence in a small region of interest within
a cell, and the ensuing time-dependent recovery of fluorescence in
the bleached region is quantified as an indicator of protein mobility.
Similarly, the photoswitching behavior of certain photochromic FPs
(discussed in <xref rid="sec2.1.3" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec2.1.3" ref-type="other">2.1.3</xref></xref>) can be used for the same goal. Rather than photobleaching,
FP molecules in a small region are photoconverted by exposure to a
characteristic illumination wavelength. The ensuing emergence of the
photoconverted fluorescence signal in another region of interest can
then be detected and quantified over time as an indication of protein
mobility. Monomeric photoactivatable or photoswitchable FP variants
are particularly useful for monitoring protein trafficking within
the cell. For instance, a recent study by Gerlitz et al. developed
transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> expressing DRONPA-s,
a photoactivatable FP, which enabled the tracking of proteins between
cells to define cell-to-cell protein transport.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref93">93</xref></sup></p><p>Lastly, FP labels are useful for visualizing the
subcellular localization
of proteins in single cells. An FP-tagged POI can be coimaged with
an organelle dye/tag or another FP-tagged control protein which is
known to localize to a certain cellular compartment. The degree of
overlap between the fluorescence signals from the tagged POI and the
localization marker can be analyzed to determine whether the POI localizes
to the identified compartment. By imaging cells over time, changes
in subcellular localization can also be tracked. For instance, a recent
study used this approach to design a drug-discovery platform targeting
chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1), which is responsible for
controlling nuclear trafficking of proteins and has emerged as an
avenue for overcoming therapy resistance in cancer patients. By tagging
an array of nuclear proteins with either RFP or GFP, researchers were
able to elucidate the mode of nuclear export for several nuclear proteins.
This same platform was then used as a screen to discover drugs that
disrupt CRM1-dependent nuclear export.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref94">94</xref></sup> This simple and widely applicable approach highlights the complex
spatial biology that can be revealed using FPs as labels.</p><p>FPs

considerations for using split FPs to detect PPIs include
high SNR, low spontaneous reassembly independent of POI proximity,

this prevents the identification of interaction dynamics. Many applications

of PPIs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref109">109</xref></sup> as it allows for the measurement
of proximity between FPs<sup>17</sup> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>c). As mentioned previously, the F&#x000f6;rster
distance depends on the degree of overlap between the absorption or
excitation spectrum of the acceptor and the emission spectrum of the
donor (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>d),
and the alignment or orientation of the donor and acceptor dipoles.
FRET efficiency depends on the distance between the donor and acceptor
and can therefore be harnessed to serve as a spectroscopic or molecular
ruler that monitors dynamic PPIs in the live-cell context.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref110">110</xref></sup> In designing a FRET-based PPI detection assay,
it is important to consider the type of FRET experiment being conducted.
In general, distinguishing PPIs will require detection of intermolecular
FRET, wherein the donor and acceptor FPs are fused to two different
proteins. The selection of FRET pairs for the detection assay will
depend on the imaging setup available and other experimental settings,
as there are several types of FRET pairs and diverse FPs that can
be used, including but not limited to CFP-YFP pairs, GFP-RFP pairs,
far-red FP-infrared FP pairs, LSS FP pairs, and dark FP-based FRET
pairs. A more thorough list of FRET pairs has been generated and capably
reviewed elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref111">111</xref></sup> Importantly, because
most FPs exhibit some degree of overlap between their own excitation
and emission spectra, FRET can also be measured between spectrally
identical FPs (i.e., homo-FRET), although this requires more specialized
equipment than monitoring FRET between spectrally distinct FPs (i.e.,
hetero-FRET), which is thus more commonly employed.</p><p>FRET can
be quantified through several methods. The most common method for
monitoring FRET involves ratiometric quantification of sensitized
emission, wherein the intensity of donor-sensitized acceptor emission
(i.e., acceptor emission after donor excitation; FRET signal) is divided
by the intensity of donor-direct emission (i.e., donor emission after
donor excitation). Although this method is simple to implement, it
can lead to variability between different microscope setups because
it is not directly measuring the FRET efficiency. Furthermore, emission-ratio
imaging is only suitable in contexts where the ratio of donor and
acceptor is fixed. Altered fluorescence polarization can also relate
to the change in FRET efficiency by polarization-resolved FRET. Fluorescence
anisotropy measures the changing orientation or rotational motion
of FPs in time and space upon excitation by polarized light.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref112">112</xref></sup> Specifically, a donor fluorophore is excited
with vertically polarized light and consequent changes in the vertical
and horizontal components of emitted light are compared to the total
emission in the measurement of fluorescence anisotropy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref112">112</xref></sup> Given the slow rotational motion of FPs relative
to their fluorescence lifetime (see below) and the imperfect alignment
between FPs in a FRET pair, light emitted by the FRET acceptor will
be more depolarized with respect to the excitation light, leading
to a decrease in anisotropy. Other quantification methods for FRET
include quantifying changes over time via spectral imaging, acceptor
photobleaching, or donor fluorescence lifetime imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref111">111</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref113">113</xref></sup> Fluorescence lifetime imaging in particular is increasingly being
used for FRET quantification. The fluorescence lifetime of a fluorophore
refers to the time that a fluorophore spends in the excited state
before it relaxes back down to the ground state (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>e). Excited-state lifetime
is shortened by the availability of nonradiative paths back to the
ground state. Thus, when a donor FP transfers energy to an acceptor
FP, its fluorescence lifetime is decreased. Fluorescence lifetime
imaging microscopy (FLIM) can provide a direct readout of altered
FRET efficiency from the measured change in lifetime of the donor
fluorophore.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref114">114</xref></sup> Because fluorescence lifetime
is an intrinsic fluorophore property, FLIM-FRET measurements are insensitive
to changes in intensity caused by variable FP expression, illumination
levels, sample thickness, etc., and allow robust, quantitative comparisons
between experiments and instruments. Furthermore, as only donor fluorescence
is measured in FLIM-FRET, potential issues related to spectral crosstalk
between donor and acceptor channels can be minimized. Nevertheless,
much like fluorescence anisotropy, FLIM-FRET requires specialized
hardware to implement.</p><p>A basic application of FRET for detecting
PPIs is exemplified by
a recent study that detected the interaction between the apoptotic
proteins XT and Bad via CFP or YFP fusion tags to each protein.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref115">115</xref></sup> Upon proximity of CFP and YFP to one another
induced by the interaction of these two apoptotic proteins, FRET efficiency
increased as an indication of a successful PPI. In another application,
a high-throughput FRET-based assay was developed to detect the key
amino acid residues required for maintaining the interaction between
antizyme, an endogenous cell cycle inhibitor and tumor suppressor,
and the antizyme inhibitor protein (AZIN).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref116">116</xref></sup> The assay incorporates Clover-tagged AZIN and mRuby2-tagged antizyme,
which are imaged to detect PPIs via an increase in FRET. Such a FRET-based
design can be used for screening drugs that inhibit the interaction
between antizyme and AZIN and highlight the translational impact of
FRET-based PPI assays in the potential identification of novel therapeutic
strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.2.3"><label>2.2.3</label><title>Visualizing Nucleic Acids</title><p>An early

is to perform imaging using reporter systems such as the previously
discussed CRISPR sgRNA/Cas9 system or the MS2 system. MS2 sequences
are bacteriophage-derived stem-loops that can be used to label RNAs

are indispensable for our understanding of protein expression and

gained traction with major technological breakthroughs that shift
the focus to the starting material, the mRNAs being translated, rather
than the translation product.</p><p>One of the first studies to image
translation events was reported by the Chao lab in 2015. Halstead
and colleagues took advantage of the sequential displacement of RNA-binding
proteins during translation to develop a method to detect this process.
Specifically, a transcript of interest was labeled with nuclear targeted
PCP-GFP and MCP-RFP stem-loops recognizing the coding region (including
a PP7 stem loop) and 3&#x02032; untranslated region (UTR, including
MS2 stem loop) of the transcript, respectively. Upon initiation of
translation, the mRNA is exported from the nucleus, and PP7-GFP is
displaced from the transcript, whereas MS2-RFP remains bound.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref141">141</xref></sup> The following year, the Stasevich lab developed
their nascent chain tracking (NCT) technique, in which a sequence

They further developed an HA-tag based Spaghetti Monster to simultaneously
image translation from two mRNA transcripts in single cells.</p><p>In 2016, three studies were published presenting novel methods
to detect the translation of mRNA transcripts of interest in real
time based on FP labels. These methods are based on the SunTag system,
which was originally developed to induce signal amplification by enabling
the recruitment of multiple copies of GFP to a protein of interest.
Briefly, the SunTag system involves tagging a POI with a peptide epitope
which can recruit a synthetic single-chain intracellular antibody

tag allows recruitment of multiple GFP-labeled scFVs, leading to amplification
of the fluorescent signal at the POI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref143">143</xref></sup> Based on this system, the Tanenbaum, Singer, and Zhuang laboratories

PP7 or MCP will cause recruitment GFP-scFV near the mRNA of interest
during translation. The Zhuang lab utilized their platform to identify

achieve more specific labeling of subcellular compartments and processes.
For instance, Yang and colleagues recently identified aggregation
of RFPs used in the study of mitochondrial transfer, including DsRed

that can release contents by exocytosis that may be mistaken for mitochondrial
transfer, a process that is harnessed by certain cell types to improve
mitochondrial function via transfer of mitochondrial DNA or proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref151">151</xref></sup> Although the specific mechanism underlying
lysosomal aggregation of mitochondria-targeted DsRed and mCherry is

to appear at lysosomes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref152">152</xref></sup> To generate
a more reliable assay for studying mitochondrial transfer, Taiko et

aggregate at lysosomes and was suitable for visualizing intercellular
transfer of viable mitochondria. Imaging of mitochondria-targeted
TurboRFP revealed that immortalized human amniotic epithelial cells
can transfer healthy mitochondria to HEK293T cells with damaged mitochondrial
DNA and mitochondrial dysfunction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref152">152</xref></sup> Along
with emphasizing the importance of developing robust and well-controlled
experiments, this approach highlights the impact that FP-labeling
of organelles can have on our understanding of diverse cellular processes,
such as cell-to-cell communication.</p><p>Methods have also been developed
to label organelles without direct fusion to an FP, thereby avoiding
potential disruption of endogenous organelle dynamics and behavior.
One example harnessed the unique biotinylation reaction between biotinylated
substrate protein (BCCP) and biotin protein ligase (BPL),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref153">153</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref154">154</xref></sup> which leads to the formation of a stable complex between these proteins.
This system was utilized to label and characterize the nuclear envelope
during mitosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref155">155</xref></sup> In this strategy, BCCP
is fused to GFP and localized to the nucleus using a C-terminal NLS
(nuclear localization sequence). BPL is fused to the C-terminus of
the transmembrane domain of the human platelet-derived growth factor
receptor, enabling it to face the cytoplasm or nucleoplasm. BCCP-GFP-NLS
interacts with BPL and localizes to the nuclear envelope, potentially
without disrupting native behavior. This approach enabled imaging
and characterization of the dynamic breakdown and reformation of the
nuclear envelope during mitosis. Cytoskeletal labeling (&#x003b2;-actin
and &#x003b1;-tubulin) was also accomplished using this approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref156">156</xref></sup> An alternative strategy to label organelles
without direct FP fusion involves using the transient interactions
between small (21&#x02013;28 residue) helical protein tags called K-
and E-coils, or KECs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref157">157</xref></sup> In this strategy,
an FP is fused to the E-coil, which can interact with a POI-fused
K-coil. This method is advantageous because it reduces the load on
the POI, replacing the relatively bulky FP barrel with a small helical
structure. KECs can also label newly synthesized proteins because
the maturation time of the FP chromophore will not significantly affect
labeling and there will be mature FPs readily available to label newly
translated proteins. Practical considerations for this approach include
developing a better understanding of the effect of such interactions,
despite their transience, on endogenous protein behavior and the intrinsic
biological function of these new interaction partners, if any.</p><p>Not only can FP labels reveal dynamic behaviors of organelles,
they can be harnessed to reveal the complex trafficking pathways that
proteins take to reach their target organelles. For example, mCherry
Timer FPs have been used to track delivery of LAMP-2A to lysosomes
and characterize its trafficking pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> Through this approach, Subach et al. suggested that LAMP-2A is trafficked

by monitoring of contacts between coat protein complex I (COPI) coat
components and the ER-resident DsI tethering complex.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref161">161</xref></sup> There have been useful advancements made by
these types of assays, but the irreversible interaction between BiFC
components can be an impediment to studying endogenous organelle interactions.
To address this, FRET has been utilized to detect organelle contact
sites, as FRET, unlike BiFC, is reversible and should not disrupt
the endogenous dynamics of the contacts. Although organelle contact
sites are defined by a proximity of 10&#x02013;80 nm,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref158">158</xref></sup> which hits the upper limit for FRET detection, a FRET-FLIM
system could nevertheless be used to identify the molecular determinants
of ER-Golgi contact sites, including the specific proteins involved
(VAP and ORP proteins). Specifically, GFP was fused to the Golgi membrane
protein TGN46 and mCherry to the ER membrane protein cytochrome b5.
FRET between the two proteins decreased the GFP fluorescence lifetime,
enabling the identification of ER-Golgi contacts using FRET-FLIM measurements.
This strategy was then used to conduct an siRNA screen to identify
the specific ER- and Golgi-resident proteins involved in the formation
of these specific contact sites.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref162">162</xref></sup></p><p>Compared to BiFC, FRET is advantageous due to its reversibility,
which does not tamper with native contacts as significantly as the
irreversible nature of BiFC pairs. However, this perceived drawback
of BiFC has also been exploited as a tool to manipulate organelle
interactions or contacts and assess the effects on cellular biology.
For example, the irreversible feature of BiFC has been used to &#x0201c;glue&#x0201d;
chloroplasts in plant cells to one another and regulate organellar
interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref163">163</xref></sup> The application of BiFC
as an organellar glue was later used by Ishikawa and colleagues to
manipulate the plant metabolome, which could be a process exploited
in the future to generate important metabolites or molecules for the
pharmaceutical industry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref164">164</xref></sup> Such unique
applications of FP-based assays leverage aspects of a system that
have traditionally been perceived as limitations to develop novel

which are crucial signaling sites that are involved in development
and neuronal signaling, among other processes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref165">165</xref></sup> Thus, approaches to label and detect cell&#x02013;cell contacts
can elucidate their functional roles in various disease contexts.
To study cellular contacts at synapses, Kim et al. developed mGRASP,
a fragment-complementation-based labeling approach that utilizes GFP<sub>1&#x02013;10</sub> and GFP<sub>11</sub> fused to fragments of the
pre- and postsynaptic proteins neurexin 1&#x003b2; and neuroligin-1,
such that proximity of the protein fragments will permit GFP reconstitution
and visualization of interacting synaptic membranes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref166">166</xref></sup> Tsetsenis and colleagues then developed SynView, which
fused GFP<sub>1&#x02013;10</sub> and GFP<sub>11</sub> to the full-length
synaptic proteins (neurexin-1&#x003b2; and neuroligin-1 or neuroligin-2)
that bind trans-synaptically, thereby marking synapses with GFP fluorescence
via PPI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref167">167</xref></sup> These approaches are just a
few of the ways FPs can be exploited to label cellular contacts and
provide a deeper understanding of cellular communication in the live-cell
context.</p><p>On a broader scale, cells themselves can be labeled
with different FPs to distinguish populations or types of cells in
a population. A classic example of using FPs to label cell types is
the &#x0201c;brainbow&#x0201d; method.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref168">168</xref></sup> In this approach, a novel transgenic strategy was used to introduce
multiple copies of three different FPs into neurons with incompatible
lox sites in various parts of the inset gene. Recombination causes
different gene fragments to be cut out, leading to variable expression
of the FPs and a distinct assortment of colors being expressed in
each cell. This technique has been the inspiration for more recent
developments targeting different subpopulations of cells. For instance,
a 2019 study reported the development of a method to label the metastatic
niche of breast cancer cells found in the lung by using &#x0201c;leaky
FPs&#x0201d;, which can be released from cancer cells and taken up
by neighboring cells found in the metastatic niche. To achieve this,
the authors modified mCherry with a membrane-permeable trans-activator
of transcription (TATk) peptide to generate sLP-mCherry. This construct
was coexpressed with GFP in breast cancer cells that were introduced
into mice via tail-vein injection. As the breast cancer cells metastasized
to the lung, cells in the metastatic niche could be identified by
FACS to select for mCherry fluorescence. These cells can then be used
for downstream studies such as single-cell sequencing to further characterize
the metastatic niche. The use of this FP-based technology led to the
identification of a lung epithelial compartment in the metastatic
niche that exhibits dedifferentiation and tissue stem cell-like features.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref169">169</xref></sup></p><p>Similar to the use of Timer FPs to trace
gene expression or organelle
dynamics over time, FPs have also been used trace cell lineages. In
this approach, FPs are expressed from cell-type-specific promoters
to drive expression only in certain cell types (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref></xref>c). Once the FP is expressed in these cells,
lineage tracing can be performed to identify daughter cells and their
characteristics. This method was pioneered in the 1980s with site-specific
recombinase technology that allows for the breaking of DNA and then
recombinase-mediated joining through site-specific gene integration
or excision. The commonly used system for this is the inducible Cre/LoxP
system.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref170">170</xref></sup> For instance, homologous recombination
in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) was utilized to drive expression
of nuclear-localized Cerulean, plasma membrane-targeted mKate2, and
tamoxifen-inducible expression of EYFP only in melanocytes to achieve
lineage tracing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref171">171</xref></sup> This strategy was taken
a step further with the development of optical barcoding, which uses
a fluorescent barcoding system with the introduction of up to three
spectrally distinct FPs, combined in six different constructs, into
target cells, wherein the combination of FPs expressed serves as a
genetic barcode for each cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref172">172</xref></sup> Similar
work was done to develop optical barcoding systems that can track
tumor heterogeneity. Six spectrally distinct FPs were utilized, and

up to 41 distinct barcodes, made up of 3, 2, or 1 color. Tumor heterogeneity
of cell populations was characterized by identifying expressed FPs

live mice is one method used to achieve <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging
using shorter-wavelength FPs such as GFP. As red-shifted wavelengths
allow for greater tissue depth and reduced light scattering, advances
in far-red or infrared FP development are crucial to enabling advancements
to deep-tissue imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref175">175</xref></sup> An early example

of FP fusion tags have enabled the
study of cellular biology at diverse scales, from molecular to subcellular
to organismal. As FP properties are improved and engineered for use
in different contexts, along with advances in imaging and genetic
manipulation techniques, our ability to illuminate diverse and complex
biological phenomena will continue to expand. But the utility of FPs
expands further than their role as labels. As discussed below, the
design of FP-based biosensors that can detect molecular events and
signaling activities is a rapidly growing field that has already greatly
enhanced our understanding of the spatiotemporal regulation of cellular
signaling and will continue to do so.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Engineered Sensors</title><p>In contrast to the
above tagging approaches, in which the FP is
primarily used as a static label whose spectral properties are not
affected by the biological process being tracked, engineered genetically
encoded FP-based biosensors are designed to directly link the intrinsic
fluorescence properties of FPs to the detection of molecular events
such that fluorescence changes provide a readout for cellular signaling.
In general, FP-based biosensor designs incorporate a modular architecture
comprising two distinct elements: a sensing unit and a reporting unit.</p><p>The sensing unit of an FP-based biosensor detects the molecular
target or activity of interest. In most biosensors, the sensing unit
is designed to serve as a &#x0201c;molecular switch&#x0201d; that undergoes
a conformational change in response to target recognition. This conformational
change in the sensing unit is then transmitted to the reporting unit
through conformational coupling, leading to a change in biosensor
fluorescence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref183">183</xref></sup> Sensing units are often
constructed based on proteins that are directly involved in the signaling
pathway of interest, therefore conferring some degree of both sensitivity
to and selectivity for the desired target. Molecular switch behavior
can be achieved using a single component, for example, by relying
on the intrinsic conformational change of a single protein or domain
that binds an analyte of interest, or by combining multiple components,
such as a binding domain paired with an interacting peptide. Specific
examples of sensing unit designs are discussed in more detail in later
sections of this review, organized by signaling target.</p><p>The
biosensor reporting unit consists of one or more FPs that can
provide a quantifiable readout for the signaling event of interest.
Depending on how the sensing and reporting units are linked, this
readout can take several forms, including changes in fluorescence
intensity or resonance energy transfer, whether FRET or BRET. In certain
cases, such as pH or temperature sensing, the reporting unit also
doubles as the sensing unit, resulting in a unified design. In general,
biosensors can be classified as using either single- or multicomponent
reporting unit designs depending on whether their optical readout
is driven by one or more emissive sources. For the purposes of this
review, we generally regard multicomponent reporting units as consisting
of two FPs, or an FP paired with a luciferase in BRET-based designs,
whose proximity and orientation are altered by the sensing unit, whereas
single-component reporting units feature modulation of only one FP
as the source of fluorescent signal. Below, we discuss several common
strategies for constructing biosensors incorporating multi- and single-component
reporting units, as well as some practical considerations related
to implementing either variety.</p><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Multicomponent Reporting Units</title><p>Multicomponent
reporting units utilize interactions among two or more FPs to provide
an optical readout of signaling or activity, as detected by the sensing
unit. These readout modes include changes in FRET between a pair of
FPs, changes in BRET between an FP and a luciferase, and changes in
the intensity of dimerization-dependent FP (ddFP) pairs. Given their
relatively straightforward construction, multicomponent sensors are
often the go-to design solution when developing a new sensor class.
While many sensor classes have gone on to adopt single-component reporting
unit designs as well, multicomponent reporting units remain robust
and popular tools.</p><p>Among multicomponent reporting unit designs,
FRET-based biosensors are quite common, and FRET-based designs often
lie at the root of biosensor family trees. As discussed previously
(<xref rid="sec2.1.1" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec2.1.1" ref-type="other">2.1.1</xref></xref>),
FRET describes the ability of a donor fluorophore to nonradiatively
transfer excited-state energy to a spectrally compatible acceptor
fluorophore, in a manner that depends on both proximity and orientation
(<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>a, upper).
Given this strict dependence, FRET can provide a highly sensitive
readout for changes in protein conformation. Thus, FRET-based biosensor
designs typically feature a sensing unit sandwiched between a pair
of FPs, such that conformational changes within the sensing unit will
alter the inter-FP distance and orientation, and thus FRET efficiency.
Classic examples of spectrally compatible FRET FP pairs include GFP/RFP
and CFP/YFP, but there is a myriad of FRET pairs that can be used
in biosensors. For instance, red/far-red and yellow/red FP pairs have
been used to develop FRET-based biosensors that are more suitable
for multiplexed imaging applications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref184">184</xref></sup> Although several methods of quantification are available (as discussed
in <xref rid="sec2.2.2.2" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec2.2.2.2" ref-type="other">2.2.2.2</xref></xref>), FRET-based biosensor responses are generally monitored by quantifying
changes in the acceptor-to-donor emission ratio, wherein the intensity
of donor-sensitized acceptor emission (acceptor fluorescence upon
donor excitation) is divided by the donor-direct emission intensity
(donor fluorescence upon donor excitation), or changes in the excited-state
lifetime of the donor fluorophore, which should decrease as a function
of increasing FRET efficiency (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>d). Monitoring two wavelengths reduces the influence
of intrinsic (e.g., cell thickness, sensor expression) and external
(e.g., instrument variations) factors on the fluorescence signal,
as these will likely impact both FPs similarly and be canceled out
by calculating the ratios. Ratiometric readouts are thus advantageous
for comparing responses across experiments and instrument set-ups,
in addition to enabling absolute determination of analyte (e.g, pH,
ions) levels. Lifetime measurements offer similar benefits, as excited-state
lifetime is an intrinsic property that is insensitive to fluorescence
intensity.</p><p>BRET-based sensors are analogous to FRET-based designs,
except
that the donor FP is replaced with a luciferase and its corresponding
substrate. As with FRET-based reporting units, the luciferase is paired
with a spectrally appropriate FP (RLuc and variants are commonly paired
with GFP). Upon detection of an analyte or signaling event, a conformational
change in the sensing unit will alter the proximity between the luciferase
donor and FP acceptor, resulting in a change in BRET efficiency. Importantly,
luciferases produce light through a chemical reaction and thus do
not require external illumination to reach their excited state. As
such, BRET-based sensors tend to exhibit very low background from
a lack of cellular autofluorescence, as well as reduced photoxicity,
compared with FRET-based sensors. However, BRET-based sensors are
comparatively dim due to relatively poor quantum efficiencies of the
luciferase&#x02013;luciferin systems, confounded by a number of other
crucial parameters such as catalytic efficiencies of luciferases and
local concentrations of the substrates.</p><p>An alternative multicomponent
reporting unit design features ddFPs
such as ddRFP, ddGFP, or ddYFP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref185">185</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref186">186</xref></sup> The development
of ddFPs was inspired by the need for an FP complementation approach
utilizing RFP, which has been seldom used in such approaches because
RFPs are usually obligate tetramers. While oligomerization stabilizes
the chromophore and yields brighter fluorescence, it can interfere
with the underlying biology being probed and has therefore been unfavorable
for many applications of RFPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref></sup> However,
the Campbell lab was able to harness this property to engineer a series
of FP pairs that greatly increase in brightness upon dimerization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref185">185</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref186">186</xref></sup> ddFP pairs consist of a dimly fluorescent FP-A and a nonfluorescent
FP-B, in which FP-A greatly increases in brightness upon binding of
FP-B (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>a, lower). ddFP-based reporters can be designed
to produce either a ratiometric or intensiometric response, depending
on how the sensing unit is coupled to the ddFPs. For example, an intensiometric
response can be achieved by simply sandwiching a sensing unit molecular
switch between a ddFP pair, such that conformational changes will
alter dimer formation and thus fluorescence intensity. Alternatively,
a ratiometric readout can be obtained by taking advantage of the fact
that multiple FP-As (e.g., RFP-A and GFP-A) can bind the same FP-B,
leading to a phenomenon known as ddFP exchange. Here, the reporting
unit incorporates three components, two FP-As of different colors
and a single FP-B, with the signaling-induced conformational change
triggering exchange of one ddFP pair for another to yield an emission
ratio change. The flexibility of ddFP-based systems makes them attractive
for the development of both ratiometric and intensiometric sensors.
For intensiometric sensors in particular, though, single-component
biosensors have also become an attractive option.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Types of reporting units.
(a) Multicomponent reporting units can
be based on FRET (upper panel) or dimerization-dependent FPs (ddFPs,
lower panel). In the FRET system, the donor (green) and acceptor (red)
fluorophores are tagged to the termini of the sensing unit (purple).
Upon a sensing a specific molecular event, a conformational change
in the sensing unit alters the proximity and orientation of the donor
and acceptor fluorophores, resulting in a change in FRET. In the ddFP-based
system, ddFP-A (dimly fluorescent) and ddFPB (nonfluorescent) are
tethered to either end of the sensing unit. Analogous to the FRET-based
design, a conformational change resulting from a sensing event alters
the interaction between the two ddFP partners, modulating the fluorescence
intensity of ddFP-A. (b) Single-component reporting units can consist
of a single FP that exhibits sensitivity to the target (upper panel).
In this reporting scheme, the target directly binds to the FP chromophore
and leads to altered fluorescence intensity. Alternatively, a circularly
permuted FP (cpFP) can be integrated with a sensing unit, with the
sensing event leading to altered fluorescence intensity in the cpFP.
(c) An example of translocation-based reporting, in which the function
of tandem nuclear localization and export signals is modulated by
a molecular event (e.g., kinase-mediated phosphorylation of a substrate
peptide; T, threonine), leading to changes in the nucleocytoplasmic
shuttling of a tethered FP. (d) Phase separation-based reporting involves
tagging an FP to a peptide or protein capable of forming dynamic,
multivalent interactions in response to a molecular event, sequestering
the FP into phase-separated biomolecular condensates, shown here as
green cytosolic puncta.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="cr4c00293_0005" id="gr5" position="float"/></fig></sec><sec id="sec3.2"><label>3.2</label><title>Single-Component Reporting Units</title><p>Single-component reporting unit designs modulate the signal from
a single FP as their optical readout and are thus sometimes referred
to as single-FP biosensors (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>b). These biosensors generally occupy less spectral
space than multicomponent reporting unit designs and are thus more
amenable to multiplexed imaging. The generally smaller size of single-FP
sensors can also potentially alleviate some of the stress put upon
cells when expressing exogenous DNA. While multicomponent reporting
units still often serve as a starting point for biosensor development,
recent years have seen considerable growth in the development and
optimization of biosensors containing only a single FP as the reporting
unit.</p><p>Single-component reporting units can be constructed in
several different ways, with the simplest being direct fusion of the
sensing unit to the N- or C- terminus of an FP. Many lipid sensors,
for instance, fuse an FP directly to a lipid-binding domain, such
that translocation of fluorescence to (or from) a membrane surface
signals the production (or degradation) of a particular lipid species.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref187">187</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref188">188</xref></sup> Kinase translocation reporters (KTRs) are another type of translocation-based
sensor, in which a single FP is fused to a kinase substrate that contains
both a nuclear localization (NLS) and nuclear export signal (NES).
Upon phosphorylation of the substrate, the NLS is disrupted, allowing
nuclear export of fluorescence to serve as the readout<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref189">189</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref190">190</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>c). A recent
twist on this approach leverages the phenomenon of liquid&#x02013;liquid
phase separation (LLPS), in which initially diffuse molecules spontaneously
coalesce to form discrete, liquid-like assemblies, or condensates,
within cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref191">191</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref193">193</xref></sup> LLPS-based sensor designs utilize a bimolecular
design, in which each half of the split sensing unit is fused to an
oligomerization domain, such as tetrameric or hexameric HOTag coiled-coils.
One part of this bimolecular switch also incorporates the FP reporting
unit. Activation of a cellular signal triggers multivalent interactions
between sensing unit oligomers, resulting in the formation of droplet-like
biosensor condensates, visualized as the redistribution of FP fluorescence
from the cytosol to these punctate structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref194">194</xref></sup> (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>d). While these translocation-based biosensor designs have proven
successful, a more versatile strategy has been to use the sensing
unit to directly alter the fluorescence properties of the FP as a
readout of signaling activity. For instance, an early voltage sensor
was constructed by fusing a single FP to the C-terminus of a voltage-gated
ion channel, wherein voltage changes alter FP fluorescence intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref195">195</xref></sup> However, a more generalizable approach to modulating
the fluorescence of a single FP involves completely integrating the
reporting unit FP with a sensing unit molecular switch. Most commonly,
this is accomplished by inserting a cpFP (discussed in <xref rid="sec2.1.5" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec2.1.5" ref-type="other">2.1.5</xref></xref>) into the
sensing unit. Specifically, the sensing unit components are fused
to the N and C termini of the cpFP, located in &#x003b2;-strand 7.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref></sup> Upon detection of the signal of interest, the
conformational change in the sensing unit acts to distort the cpFP
&#x003b2;-barrel structure, which alters the chromophore environment
and affects the fluorescence signal (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref></xref>b). Typically, this results in a change in
fluorescence intensity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref196">196</xref></sup> but other effects,
including changes in excitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref197">197</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref199">199</xref></sup> or emission<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref198">198</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref200">200</xref></sup> spectra or

show significantly higher responses and sensitivity when compared

changes <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, cpFPs are only available
in a somewhat limited range of colors, and expanding the palette of

influenced by particular components of the sensor. For instance, the
selectivity for one target over another is largely determined by the

spectral identity and photophysical properties of the sensor. However,
while careful choice of sensing unit and reporting unit will give
strong starting points in the design of a sensor with particular properties,
the way the two components affect one another cannot be overstated.
Thus, optimization of the linkers and combinations of reporting and
sensing units are crucial to biosensor development.</p><sec id="sec3.3.1"><label>3.3.1</label><title>Fundamental Parameters</title><p>Many fundamental
aspects of biosensor performance are determined by the sensing unit.
For instance, a biosensor must demonstrate selectivity for the target
of interest, ideally recognizing the target without responding to
other similar molecules. The biosensor should also have affinity for
the target within a physiologically relevant concentration range that
corresponds to the native cellular conditions in which it is being
detected. The precise physiological range can vary depending upon
the organism, cell type, or even subcellular compartment in which
a biosensor is being expressed, as various analytes and proteins can
be present in each of these locations at varying concentrations. This
point is well illustrated in the case of the ZifCY and ZapCY sensors,
which were used to detect subcellular zinc ion (Zn<sup>2+</sup>) levels
at various compartments based on their relative Zn<sup>2+</sup> affinities<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref207">207</xref></sup> (discussed in <xref rid="sec5.2.1" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec5.2.1" ref-type="other">5.2.1</xref></xref>).</p><p>The reporting unit can similarly
influence biosensor performance. The choice of FP in biosensor development
is crucial as it can affect the brightness and excitation and emission
wavelengths of the sensor, and compound with characteristics of the
sensing unit to affect dynamic range and sensitivity. FP excitation
and emission wavelengths determine the spectral identity (i.e., color)
of the FP, and different illumination wavelengths are more (shorter
wavelength/bluer light) or less phototoxic or able to penetrate through
tissues (longer wavelength/redder light). Brighter FPs will be more
visible and are often chosen for biosensor development for this reason.
Different FPs also mature at different rates (see <xref rid="sec2.1.2" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec2.1.2" ref-type="other">2.1.2</xref></xref>). In general, this process
is slower for RFPs than for GFP variants, as chromophore maturation
requires an additional oxygen-dependent step.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref208">208</xref></sup> Incomplete maturation can affect biosensor performance,
resulting in lower fluorescence signal, which should be taken into
account when designing biosensors with multicomponent reporting units
featuring red or orange FPs, which sometimes exhibit this incomplete
maturation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref209">209</xref></sup> FPs also vary in their photostability
and many will bleach upon extended illumination. Thus, FPs with good
photostability should be used whenever possible in sensor design.
Another FP-specific consideration is the fact that many FPs are pH
sensitive. Depending on the application, this may be desirable or
something to be avoided, and so should be considered in the design
of a biosensor. Considerations related to pH are discussed in more
detail in the Application Considerations section (<xref rid="sec3.3.3" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec3.3.3" ref-type="other">3.3.3</xref></xref>).</p><p>From these fundamental
sensing and reporting unit parameters emerge
features of overall biosensor performance, which impact biosensor
applications across diverse contexts. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
is often used to quantify biosensor performance, which reflects how
clearly the biosensor fluorescence response (signal) can be detected
above fluctuations in the basal fluorescence (noise) and can be determined
by dividing the amplitude of the sensor response by the standard deviation
of the baseline. Higher values indicate greater reliability in measuring
target biochemical changes. The contribution of noise increases as
less light from the biosensor is able to reach the detector, a particular
challenge when working with complex specimens where light scattering
is more prominent, such as in tissue and <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging.
One solution is thus to use the brightest sensor with the highest
available dynamic range. The dynamic range of a biosensor is defined
as the maximum difference between the fluorescence signals in the
fully &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; and fully &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; biosensor states.
Biosensors with large dynamic ranges hold greater utility in detecting
minute changes in target concentrations or activity, such as at the
subcellular level. Ideally, a high dynamic range can be achieved by
pairing a sensing unit that undergoes a large conformational change
with a reporting unit where the chromophore is sensitive to changes
in the molecular environment, such as the cpEGFP in GCaMP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref210">210</xref></sup> which has been demonstrated to show large changes
in fluorescence upon Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding. However, actual performance
depends on efficient coupling between the sensing and reporting units,
which can be hard to predict.</p><p>These fundamental aspects of biosensor
function influence their
overall sensitivity and performance and can be carefully selected
to produce an ideal biosensor for a specific application.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3.2"><label>3.3.2</label><title>Design Optimization</title><p>The overall
performance of a biosensor is a synthesis of multiple more fundamental
parameters, with the sensitivity of the sensor the most often discussed.
Biosensor sensitivity is determined by the limit of detection and
the response to the target of interest at physiologically relevant
levels. This sensitivity and the overall performance of the biosensor,
while influenced by individual fundamental parameters such as the
affinity of the sensing unit, dynamic range, and SNR, can also be
optimized in more complex ways, often specific to particular biosensor
designs, with particular considerations for multi- versus single-component
sensors.</p><p>A critical optimization strategy for FRET-based reporters
is switching out the donor and acceptor fluorophores to identify an
optimal pair that will result in the most efficient energy transfer
in the high-FRET state. Another, complementary strategy is to include
a long flexible linker, such as the &#x0201c;extension for enhanced
visualization by evading extra FRET&#x0201d; (Eevee, or EV) linker
developed by Komatsu et al. in the Matsuda lab, to separate the FPs
and minimize energy transfer in the low-FRET state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref211">211</xref></sup> The EV linker consists of a series of flexible (SAGG)<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> repeats, where &#x0201c;<italic>n</italic>&#x0201d;
indicates the number of sequence repeats. This results in a greater
difference between the &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;off&#x0201d;
states of the reporter, and therefore a greater dynamic range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref211">211</xref></sup> In these and other cases where the reporting
unit has two components, both FPs should mature at similar rates,
to avoid artificially affecting the emission ratio, and thus potentially
affecting the biosensor response.</p><p>For biosensors incorporating
single-component reporting units,
linker optimization is a valuable strategy to improve biosensor performance.
Varying the linkers that join the cpFP to the sensing unit has allowed
for the engineering of large improvements in dynamic range in these
types of sensors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref202">202</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref212">212</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref213">213</xref></sup> The ideal linkers to use for any given biosensor are difficult to
determine through rational design, making random mutagenesis of the
linker residues the best way to develop a functional biosensor. In
some cases, a single round of linker randomization and screening may
be sufficient to identify a well-performing sensor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref213">213</xref></sup> More commonly, however, several rounds of mutagenesis of
the linkers or other parts of the sensor are applied in a directed
evolution approach.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref196">196</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref214">214</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref216">216</xref></sup> Often these efforts are focused on the linker residues, but at times
it is fruitful to induce random mutations throughout the sensor via
error-prone PCR, especially within the cpFP in single-component reporting
unit biosensors. To facilitate these efforts, novel high-throughput
screening strategies have been developed and optimized for particular
analytes of interest or sensor readouts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref217">217</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref218">218</xref></sup> These directed evolution strategies are employed in the development
of both multicomponent reporting unit and single-component reporting
unit biosensors but are especially critical for the success of single-FP
sensor strategies.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref219">219</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref220">220</xref></sup> While the details of these directed
evolution and screening efforts are outside the scope of this review,
these engineering strategies are crucial to modern biosensor development,
and are an active area of research that is instrumental in the field.</p><p>Another optimization strategy for single-FP based sensors can involve
testing different topologies for combining the sensing and reporting
units.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref204">204</xref></sup> For instance, while inserting
a cpFP between two components of a sensing unit remains a particularly
common design strategy, recent developments in single-FP biosensors
have shown that directly inserting the sensing unit into a non-circularly
permuted FP can also be an effective approach. In both cases, attaching
the sensing unit to so-called &#x0201c;gatepost&#x0201d; residues that
surround a &#x0201c;bulge&#x0201d; within the FP &#x003b2;-barrel, often
located in the seventh &#x003b2;-strand, has been suggested as a good
starting point.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref202">202</xref></sup> In all design strategies,
the use of monomeric FPs is important as well, as this will prevent
aggregation of the biosensor.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.3.3"><label>3.3.3</label><title>Application Considerations</title><p>Many
additional factors must be taken into consideration and optimized
when users seek to apply a biosensor to answer a biological question.
Decisions need to be made about which biosensors are most appropriate
for specific applications, including which design strategy and imaging
modality are most appropriate, as well as considerations specific
to the biological system being investigated.</p><p>One of the first
choices to consider is whether to use a single-component or multicomponent
biosensor. Compared to FRET-based biosensors, single-FP-based biosensors
tend to have greater dynamic ranges. In addition, incorporation of
a single FP mitigates some of the drawbacks of multi-FP design schemes,
such as high spectral occupancy or differences in FP maturation rates.
However, there are also drawbacks to cpFP-based biosensors, including
the increased sensitivity of the FP spectral properties to environmental
factors like pH and ion concentrations, as the chromophore with a
cpFP can be more exposed to the environment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref></sup> These issues can be exacerbated by the fact that they generally
lack an internal control, such as a second FP with a well-understood
pH response to account for these changes. This should be considered
for sensing schemes designed for acidic environments, such as inside
the lumen of some organelles. Because single-FP sensors are generally
intensiometric, they are also more susceptible to movement artifacts
or changes in focal plane throughout imaging compared to multicomponent
reporting unit scaffolds, where the second FP can additionally enable
correction for movement. These difficulties can be somewhat mitigated
by simply adding a second, carefully chosen FP as a point of normalization,
either by appending it to one terminus of the sensor or inserting
it within the sensor, known as the Matryoshka strategy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref209">209</xref></sup> However, this removes some of the benefits
the single-FP-based strategy, particularly the reduced spectral footprint.
cpFPs can also take more time to achieve chromophore maturation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref></sup> ddFPs also suffer from the same pH sensitivity
issues as single-component reporting unit systems, so while they remain
useful as single-color biosensors, they should be used with caution.</p><p>FRET-based biosensors or other ratiometric sensors can mitigate
this pH sensitivity, as one FP can function as an internal control
for the other, as long as the relative pH sensitivities of the two
FPs are well-understood and calibrated.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref221">221</xref></sup> As described above, compared with the typical intensiometric readout
offered by single-FP sensors, ratiometric readouts provided by FRET-based
as well as certain ddFP-based biosensors mitigate the effects of certain
variations such as cell thickness and illumination intensity and facilitate
comparison and quantification. FRET-based biosensors also have well-defined
lifetime changes, compared with single-FP based sensors. Contextualizing
the advantages and disadvantages of these different reporting schemes
to the intended use case is crucial to designing and selecting the
most appropriate biosensor.</p><p>As will be discussed in <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="other">4</xref></xref>, many biosensors
have been developed which harness
the environmental sensitivities of FPs, but the relevance of the biological
environment cannot be disregarded in the design of other biosensors,
especially in cases where such environmental factors may change with
or impact the signal of interest. For instance, detecting events within
organelle lumens requires FPs that are pH-insensitive. Biosensors
for detecting targets involved in signaling microdomains could require
further controls to check for the effects of molecular crowding on
biosensor performance. Regardless of design strategy, all biosensor
experiments should carefully consider controls to avoid or mitigate
changes in the sensor response due to effects other than the signal
of interest. While this is especially problematic for single-component
reporting designs, multicomponent reporting designs are not immune
to these effects. As discussed briefly above, and further expanded
on in <xref rid="sec4.1" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec4.1" ref-type="other">4.1</xref></xref>, many FPs are sensitive to pH changes. As such, pH changes during
a biological process are a large source of off-target fluorescence
changes in biosensors, although other environmental changes can affect
fluorescence as well. An important strategy to account for these artifacts
is the use of a &#x0201c;dead&#x0201d; sensor. In this case, a variant
of the sensor is developed which is insensitive to the signal of interest,
i.e., a target phosphorylation site is mutated to a nonphosphorylatable
residue in a kinase sensor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref222">222</xref></sup> or a binding
site is mutated to abolish affinity for the analyte of interest. These
&#x0201c;dead&#x0201d; sensors can then be used in parallel experiments
under the same stimulation conditions to correct for off-target signals
from the biosensor or to adjust experimental conditions to avoid these
artifacts. For instance, in the case of peroxide sensors like HyPer
or HyPerRed, a single mutation of a cysteine to a serine renders HyPer
insensitive to peroxide, but still sensitive to pH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref223">223</xref></sup> This &#x0201c;dead&#x0201d; sensor, termed SypHer, has subsequently
been used to account for pH changes in peroxide-sensing experiments
with HyPer and HyPerRed.</p><p>As discussed in the Fundamental Parameters <xref rid="sec3.3.1" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec3.3.1" ref-type="other">3.3.1</xref></xref>, the FPs
used in a biosensor
affect the wavelengths of light used for imaging, as well as the photostability
of the sensor. It is therefore important to choose a biosensor in
which the FP or FPs used match the context in which it will be used.
For instance, <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging applications need longer
wavelengths to penetrate tissue and therefore ideally use biosensors
occupying red, far-red, or infrared spectral space. Certain wavelengths
of light, such as those in the UV range, can also damage cells during
high-speed or long-term imaging and should be avoided for such applications.
This damage, referred to as phototoxicity, can also occur as a result
of the chemical reactions that cause photobleaching. For this reason,
photobleaching of FPs should generally be avoided by choosing FPs
with high photostability and adjusting the imaging parameters (i.e.,
number of imaging cycles, experiment duration, exposure time, emission
filters and detectors) to minimize the bleaching observed, not just
to ensure the stability of the biosensor signal but also to ensure
the health of the biological system being examined. One way to identify
photobleaching is to include a vehicle control condition. If the biosensor
signal changes over time even in response to a vehicle control, this
may indicate that photobleaching is occurring. The advances in FP
development and considerations in biosensor design discussed in this
review so far have been applied to develop biosensors for numerous
cellular targets. Specific design strategies vary between targets,
especially with respect to the sensing units used, but the broad categories
of multi- and single-component reporting unit designs, as well as
the practical considerations discussed in this section, apply across
many sensor families. These and other more specific considerations
are discussed in the following sections, as biosensors designed to
monitor specific cellular targets are discussed in more detail. The
sensors are broadly grouped according to their biological targets,
including cellular environment, ions, GPCR activation, and kinase
activity. Within these broad categories, sensors for specific analytes
are highlighted, with design considerations and biological applications
for each discussed in more depth.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="sec4"><label>4</label><title>Cell Environment</title><p>The cell environment
is defined by a myriad of factors, including
pH, temperature, mechanical strain, molecular crowding, and voltage.
Cellular signaling and function are finely attuned to changes in these
conditions, both extra- and intracellularly. Thus, it is vital to
characterize and understand dynamic changes in these environmental
cues and the ways they affect cellular biology. The FP chromophore
can often be directly sensitive to such environmental factors. Many
iterations of FPs have been engineered to remove such environmental
sensitivities, but these characteristics have also been harnessed
to monitor environmental changes. Alternatively, more advanced FP-based
environmental sensors incorporate dedicated sensing units with specific
environmental sensitivities, following a more generalized biosensor
design.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>pH</title><p>pH is defined by proton (H<sup>+</sup>) content, which is generated from organic acids found within

This can be explained by the existence of two distinct states of the
FP chromophore: a neutral, protonated form and an anionic, deprotonated
form. In GFP, protonation of the chromophore alters the excitation
spectrum, leading to enhanced excitation at 395 nm versus 475 nm,
while deprotonation leads to the reverse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref228">228</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref229">229</xref></sup> This characteristic has been exploited and
critically engineered to measure changes in fluorescence intensity
as a read-out of pH changes. In this pH sensing approach, the FP is
further mutated to directly sensitize it to the optimal range of pH
that is being sensed.</p><p>pHluorin was the first example of this
type of genetically encoded pH sensor. It was developed by histidine
scanning of sites in the GFP chromophore environment involved in forming
an H-bond network with the Tyr 66 residue of GFP, including the critical
residues Gln 94, Arg 96, His 148, Ile 167, Thr 203, and Glu 222, which
are important for stabilizing the protonated GFP chromophore state.
Altering this network enhanced sensitivity to pH at various pH ranges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref230">230</xref></sup> Specifically, several rounds of mutagenesis
resulted in the development of ratiometric pHluorin and ecliptic pHluorin.
Ratiometric pHluorin increases in excitation ratio (395/470 nm) with
increasing pH (between pH 7.5&#x02013;5.5), whereas ecliptic pHluorin
decreases in fluorescence at 470 nm excitation with more acidic pH,
with complete loss of fluorescence at pH &#x0003c; 6.0.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref230">230</xref></sup> Sankaranarayanan et al. developed a brigher, superecliptic
pHluorin that enabled greater changes in fluorescence intensity in
response to pH changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref231">231</xref></sup> Mahon later
developed pHluorin2 with enhanced brightness at 395 nm but similar
pH sensitivity as ratiometric pHluorin, which they applied to detect
changes in pH upon endocytosis of parathyroid hormone 1 receptor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref232">232</xref></sup> Inspired by pHLuorins, Li and Tsien developed
a red-shifted pH sensor, pHTomato, which is sensitive to pH 7.4 to
5.5. pHTomato was multiplexed with a calcium ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)
sensor, GCaMP3 to study the interplay between vesicular turnover and
synaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref233">233</xref></sup> More recently, Shen et al. developed a pH sensor based
off of superecliptic pHluorin by introducing mutations that increased
brightness and pH sensitivity. This pH sensor, called Lime, can detect
pH changes between pH 7.4 and 5.5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref234">234</xref></sup></p><p>A different ratiometric pH-sensing strategy was introduced by Pakhomov
et al. using Dendra2, a monomeric FP that undergoes irreversible green-to-red
photoconversion upon violet-blue excitation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref235">235</xref></sup> Photoconverted Dendra2 turns back to green in acidic environments
due to protonation of the chromophore phenol group. Using this behavior,
Pakhamov and colleagues used photoconverted Dendra2 as a ratiometric
pH sensor in which the red-to-green emission ratio correlates to increasing
pH. One limitation of this strategy is the need for three illumination
wavelengths: 400 nm light for photoconversion, 490 nm to excite the
&#x0201c;green&#x0201d; chromophore, and 555 nm to excite the &#x0201c;red&#x0201d;
chromophore. However, this strategy was suitable for measuring intracellular
pH from 7.0&#x02013;9.5 in mammalian cells (CHO and HEK293 cells).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref235">235</xref></sup> Although the large spectral space occupied
by this sensor could be a disadvantage for multiplexed imaging approaches,
the ratiometric readout is a distinct advantage for monitoring intracellular
pH changes. Another unique approach to sensing pH was introduced in
the sensor pHLIM, which, rather than quantifying changes in the emission
properties of the pH-sensing FP, relied upon pH-dependent changes
in the fluorescence lifetime of mApple, a red-emitting FP, to reduce
uncertainty by enabling absolute quantification of single-color sensors,
or improved SNR for FRET-based sensors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref236">236</xref></sup> This new sensor can sense pH changes from 4.6 to 7.4 and was utilized
to detect the pH of various endolysosomal compartments in mammalian
cells.</p><p>After the introduction of the first pH sensors, multiple
advances
have been made in the generation and application of novel pH sensors
in the live-cell context. One area that needed to be addressed involved
optimization for measuring pH in different subcellular compartments
that have variable characteristic pH ranges. For instance, pHluorin
has recently been modified to enable pH sensing in the ER, which was
not possible previously. Using a superfolder variant overcame misfolding
of the sensor due to the oxidative environment of the ER to enable
pH sensing in this compartment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref237">237</xref></sup> Similar
modifications may also enhance the use of pHluorin in other secretory
compartments.</p><p>Another organelle in which pH sensing was previously
difficult
is the lysosome due to its highly acidic environment, which confers
degradative function. Keeping this in mind, Burgstaller et al. developed
pH-Lemon, a FRET-based sensor that pairs pH-sensitive EYFP with pH-resistant
mTurquoise2 to visualize pH in acidic compartments.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref238">238</xref></sup> As the EYFP chromophore becomes protonated and thus quenched
under acidic conditions, the FRET efficiency decreases, resulting
in an increased cyan-to-yellow emission ratio for detecting changes
in pH from 7.5 to 4.5. In 2021, long-term pH sensing in the lysosomal
lumen was achieved with a new biosensor incorporating pHluorin-mCherry
fused to the luminal domain of the lysosomal marker protein LAMP1,
and a cytosolic facing 3XFLAG to make ratiometric pHluorin (RpH)-LAMP1-3xFLAG.
The sensor was well localized to lysosomes and exhibited sensitivity
to pH values relevant to the lysosomal lumen (pH 7.1&#x02013;4.2).
Using this biosensor, pH was tracked in the lysosomes of cells undergoing
various stages of the cell cycle over 5 h and during cell migration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref239">239</xref></sup> In the same year, Ponsford and colleagues developed
FIRE-pHLy, another ratiometric pH sensor for detecting lysosomal pH
within the range of 6.0&#x02013;3.5. FIRE-pHLy was engineered using
the teal-emitting FP mTFP1 and the red-emitting FP mCherry sandwiching
LAMP1. Inserting LAMP1 between the two FPs ensures luminal targeting
of the pH-sensitive mTFP and cytosolic exposure of mCherry. The sensor
was used in primary neurons and iPSCs to elucidate lysosomal pH changes
during neurodegeneration and aging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref240">240</xref></sup> Tantama,
Hung, and Yellen developed a ratiometric red pH sensor, pHRed, utilizing
the red-emitting FP mKeima as the pH-sensitive reporter, which exhibits
increased excitation at 440 nm versus 585 nm in acidic environments.
pHRed exhibited a large dynamic range (&#x0223c;10-fold) and was utilized
for pH detection in the cytosol and mitochondria within the range
of pH 9&#x02013;5.5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref241">241</xref></sup></p><p>Strategies
to optimize pH sensors for various cellular compartments

reporting unit to enable suitability for more diverse imaging modalities.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.1.2"><label>4.1.2</label><title>Applications of pH Sensors for Detecting
Exocytosis, Endocytosis, and Autophagy</title><p>Certain cellular processes
are marked by defined changes in pH levels, which can be tracked as
an indicator of the stages in these processes. Vesicular trafficking
via exo- and endocytosis, for instance, is marked by changes in luminal
pH. Endosomal maturation into lysosomes involves acidification of
the vesicular lumen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref242">242</xref></sup> At neuronal synapses,
exocytic vesicles are acidic (pH 5.6) but become alkaline (pH 7.4)

it fuses with the lysosome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref243">243</xref></sup> Such defined
changes in pH can be tracked to denote the phases of exocytosis or
autophagy, which both necessitate changes in pH. Thus, along with
enabling the detection of time-resolved and subcellular pH changes
in live cells, pH sensors can be modified to report on these cellular
processes.</p><p>The first reported use of pHluorin to detect acidification
of synaptic vesicles as they underwent exocytosis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref230">230</xref></sup> highlights the potential for using pH sensors in this capacity.
Superecliptic pHluorin was optimized precisely for this purpose and
utilized in later studies to detect vesiclular fusion events, exocytosis,
and endocytosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref244">244</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref245">245</xref></sup> Shen and colleagues later developed
pHuji, a red-emitting, pH-sensitive FP for visualization of endo-
and exocytosis concurrently with pHluorin. pHuji. and pHluorin were
coimaged to detect differential sorting of two receptors into endocytic
vesicles.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref246">246</xref></sup> A later red pH sensor for
monitoring exocytosis was developed by Liu et al, called pHmScarlet,
with enhanced sensitivity and greater brightness compared to pHuji

and colleagues tracked single-vesicle exocytosis and demonstrated
the biosensor&#x02019;s ability to distinguish the previously undetectable
docking step of exocytosis, beautifully exemplifying the utility of
pH sensors for elucidating the steps of processes involving subtle
pH changes.</p><p>In addition to exo- and endocytosis, pH sensors
have been developed
to probe autophagy, a process marked by luminal acidification of the
autophagosome. The advent of FP tagging provided unprecedented spatiotemporal
resolution in the study of autophagy, and a simple early strategy
for monitoring autophagy was the passive labeling of the autophagosome
protein LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3) with
GFP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref248">248</xref></sup> Upon autophagy initiation, autophagosome
formation can be detected by the presence of green punctate structures
in the cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref249">249</xref></sup> Although this strategy
can indicate autophagosome formation, it cannot provide time-resolved
information on autophagy progression from autophagosome to autolysosome.
Harnessing the pH-sensitivity of GFP, a second LC3-tagging strategy
was developed to distinguish stages of autophagy in live cells. In
this strategy, Kimura et al. fused mRFP and GFP in tandem to LC3 to
be expressed in the autophagosome lumen. Upon autophagosome fusion
with lysosomes, GFP fluorescence is quenched, but mRFP fluorescence
is stable, providing a fluorescent readout of autophagy progression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref250">250</xref></sup> The following year, Rosado and colleagues developed
Rosella, a similar pH-sensitive system to monitor autophagy at various
subcellular locations. This sensor includes DsRed fused to superecliptic
pHluorin. pH sensitive pHluorin indicates acidification as the biosensor
progresses through the stages of autophagy, and DsRed serves as the
stable, pH-insensitive reference.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref251">251</xref></sup> In
these sensors, however, the pH-sensitive element is not sensitive
enough to detect the acidic lysosomal pH. Zhou et al. developed the
mTagRFP-mWasabi-LC3 autophagy sensor in which the pH-sensitive element,
mWasabi, is more suitable for detecting acidic pH environments than
GFP or pHluorin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref252">252</xref></sup> The latest stage in
autophagic flux sensors focuses on engineering methods to distinguish
the stages of autophagy progression with higher sensitivity. To this
end, Kim and colleagues generated a red-green-blue autophagy sensor
incorporating three FPs with distinct pH sensitivities fused to LC3.
This sensor functions through sequential quenching of green, red,
and blue fluorescence as compartmental pH becomes increasingly acidic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref253">253</xref></sup></p><p>Building off strategies to detect autophagic
flux, pH biosensors
have recently been adapted to detect mitophagy, the autophagy of damaged
mitochondria.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref254">254</xref></sup> A mitophagy sensor, mito-SRAI
(signal-retaining autophagy indicator), was developed by Katayama
et al. in 2020 to enable quantitative readouts of mitophagy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref255">255</xref></sup> This FRET-based sensor incorporates a pH-insensitive
and acidity resistant FP, afCFP (acid-fast CFP). This FP, also named
TOLLES by Katayama et al. (TOLerance of Lysosomal EnvironmentS), is
fully fluorescent at acidic pH in the lysosomal lumen (pH 4&#x02013;5).
TOLLES is fused to YPet, which is irreversibly denatured in the acidic
environment of the lysosomal lumen. This FRET-pair exhibits high FRET
efficiency in less acidic environments but decreases in FRET as autophagy
leads to compartment acidification. In addition to enabling autophagy
detection, SRAI was targeted to the mitochondrial matrix to enable
detection of mitophagy in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and <italic>in vivo</italic> in nondopaminergic neurons of the mouse midbrain.
Furthermore, mito-SRAI was used to screen for therapeutic inducers
of mitophagy in a high-throughput context. Katayama and colleagues
identified several hits that induce mitophagy in cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref255">255</xref></sup> illustrating the diverse applicability of such
robust biosensors of cellular processes.</p><p>As demonstrated by
the capability of pH sensors to detect exocytosis
and autophagy, the biosensor toolbox holds great potential for characterizing
cellular processes that exhibit variable cellular signaling or environmental
properties, or alternatively for characterizing and quantifying changes
in the environment and signaling during certain processes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><label>4.2</label><title>Temperature</title><p>Body temperature has
long been an indicator of human health and reflects the impact that
cellular temperature changes may have on cellular health as well.
Heat is important to many cellular processes. At the molecular level,
heat can shift the equilibrium of chemical reactions within cells.
At the cellular level, temperature changes can induce altered expression
of heat shock proteins,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref256">256</xref></sup> and temperature
changes dynamically throughout the cell cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref257">257</xref></sup> Methods for monitoring temperature could therefore elucidate
the interplay between heat/temperature and cellular signaling. To
this end, there are generally two approaches for developing biosensors
to monitor temperature: leveraging the intrinsic temperature sensitivity
of FPs by monitoring thermal quenching or using a molecular switch
that changes conformation at different temperatures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref258">258</xref></sup></p><p>The earliest FP-based temperature sensor was reported
in 2007. This sensor took advantage of the intrinsic blinking properties
of EGFP using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). This imaging
method can be used to define some of the photophysical properties
of FPs that affect temporal changes in fluorescent intensity, such
as diffusion dynamics and molecular concentrations or interactions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref259">259</xref></sup> Wong et al. used EGFP in this context to measure
laser-induced heating in liquids.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref260">260</xref></sup> The
protonation/deprotonation of Tyr 66 in EGFP, and the corresponding
change in 488 nm excitation, can be correlated to temperature, as
the relaxation time associated with EGFP blinking (related to protonation
state) depends on fluctuations in temperature, which can in turn be
quantified by FCS. This sensor was not validated in cellular systems,
as EGFP blinking is also influenced by changes in pH and salt concentrations
which are variable within the cell. However, this approach presents
an early example of an FP being used to measure temperature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref260">260</xref></sup> Another study in 2012 also directly used GFP
as a thermal nanoprobe to map intracellular temperature in HeLa and
U87 glioma cells with 0.4 &#x000b0;C temperature precision. This approach
is based on the interrelation of fluorescence polarization and molecular
rotation, which is accelerated with increasing temperature. Faster
rotational motion leads to decreased fluorescence polarization. Therefore,
by measuring the polarization of GFP fluorescence emission, Donner
and colleagues used the FP as a temperature sensor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref261">261</xref></sup> In 2015, the first red-emitting temperature sensor was
generated using mRFP1 in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Different variants
of mRFP1 were made to exhibit variable sensitivities to changes in
temperature. Fluorescence intensity decreased with increasing temperature,
which Deepankumar and colleagues postulated was due to thermal quenching
of mRFP1 fluorescence, wherein a temperature change from 4 to 40 &#x000b0;C
yielded a 40.5% decrease in fluorescence intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref262">262</xref></sup> More recently, a ratiometric temperature sensor called
B-gTEMP was developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref258">258</xref></sup> This sensor is
a follow up on gTEMP, a bicistronic construct that incorporates mT-Sapphire
and the blue-emitting FP Sirius, which exhibit variable temperature
sensitivities, linked by a T2A peptide to ensure equal expression
levels in the cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref263">263</xref></sup> B-gTEMP incorporates
the tandem fusion of mNeonGreen and tdTomato to report on temperature
changes with greater SNR, faster kinetics, and greater sensitivity
(155 &#x003bc;s time resolution, 0.042 &#x000b0;C temperature resolution).
Both gTEMP and B-gTEMP rely on thermal quenching of the FP chromophore
to alter fluorescence intensity and serve as a readout of temperature
changes.</p><p>Early iterations of temperature sensors were all designs
that used
intrinsic changes in FP properties to detect temperature changes.
However, the more conventional sensing-and-reporting-unit configuration
has also been utilized to generate FP-based temperature sensors. In
2013, Kiyonaka and colleagues generated tsGFP, wherein GFP serves
as the reporting unit coupled to tandem coiled-coil structures from
the <italic>Salmonella</italic> thermosensing protein TipA as the
sensing unit. GFP is sandwiched between the two coiled-coil structures,
with changes in temperature causing conformational changes in TipA
that can induce quantifiable changes in GFP fluorescence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref264">264</xref></sup> Another such temperature sensor is the FRET-based
ELP-TEMP, which incorporates a temperature-responsive elastin-like
polypeptide with two FPs (mTurquoise2 and mVenus) to detect temperature
changes wherein increased temperature leads to greater FRET efficiency.
ELP-TEMP exhibited the highest temperature sensitivity (45.1 &#x000b1;
8.1% response/1 &#x000b0;C in the range of 33&#x02013;40 &#x000b0;C) compared
with other sensors available at the time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref265">265</xref></sup> Such improvements in temperature sensors are crucial for future
work in understanding how subcellular variations in temperature under
various conditions may cause or respond to alterations in cellular
signaling. A GFP-based sensor was recently used to resolve mitochondrial
temperature changes in cells treated with a chemical uncoupler of
oxidative phosphorylation, exhibiting the first use of an FP-based
temperature sensor to detect subcellular temperature changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref266">266</xref></sup> However, further work in improving the spatial,
temporal, and temperature resolution of these sensors is necessary
to allow more robust subcellular characterization.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><label>4.3</label><title>Mechanical Strain</title><p>Cells are responsive
to forces acting on them both extracellularly and intracellularly

be readily applied to probe forces within cells or <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, biosensors of mechanical strain can elucidate how these
molecular forces can affect cellular signaling activities in single
cells to extract more meaningful insights.</p><p>Mechanical strain
sensors rely on the elastic deformation of protein structures in response
to physical forces. By incorporating peptide linkers that can be elastically
deformed under exposure to mechanical force or strain between or within
the reporting unit(s), the sensor can provide a fluorescent readout
of this force. Many synthetic flexible linkers have been developed
and used in sensors, as well as many peptides derived from flagelliform
silk. These peptides are usually sandwiched between or linked to the
reporting unit(s), and then the whole construct is introduced into
a protein that experiences mechanical strain, such as a mechanotransducer
protein. The region of sensor integration is important for obtaining
an accurate readout of mechanical strain and should be in a mechanically
active region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref273">273</xref></sup> A simple example is the
stretch-sensitive FRET sensor (stFRET) that was developed by Meng
et al. from the Sachs lab, who linked the cyan-yellow FRET pair Cerulean
and Venus using an &#x003b1; helix.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref274">274</xref></sup> Upon
loading of force onto the sensor, the helix stretches and increases
the distance between the FRET pair, leading to reduced FRET.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref274">274</xref></sup> Inserting stFRET into different POIs allowed
Meng and colleagues to visualize spatiotemporal force exertion on
those proteins during various processes. For instance, when inserted
into actinin and filamin, stFRET revealed greater mechanical stress
at the leading edge of migrating cells than at the trailing edge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref275">275</xref></sup> stFRET was later improved by incorporating
a more relaxed (less rigid) helical peptide as the sensing unit to
achieve a wider dynamic range within the 5&#x02013;7 pN range (50%
decrease in FRET in response to increased force), while still relaying
similar stress patterns as identified by stFRET.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref276">276</xref></sup></p><p>cpstFRET (circularly permuted stretch-sensitive FRET
sensor) was
subsequently generated to overcome limitations on sensitivity and
dynamic range of the original stFRET construct stemming from the sensing
unit peptide, which basally separates the FRET pair and thus limits
the ability of stress/force application to further reduce FRET. Incorporating
circularly permuted versions of Cerulean and Venus allowed the FRET
pair to be positioned closer together and in a more favorable orientation
in the basal (relaxed) state, thus maximizing the signal difference
from the stretched state.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref277">277</xref></sup> An added benefit
of this variant is its smaller size (30% lower molecular weight) compared
to the original stFRET, making its insertion less likely to perturb
the fused target protein.</p><p>Another development was TSMod, or
tension sensor module, a FRET-based
biosensor developed by Grashoff et al. by sandwiching an elastic tension
sensing domain (40 amino acids) from silk protein flagelliform between
Venus and mTFP1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref278">278</xref></sup> To study focal adhesions,
the sensor was inserted into the mechanotransduction protein vinculin,
between the N-terminal head and C-terminal tail. <italic>In vitro</italic> validation using laser tweezers to cyclically apply stress revealed
that the sensor is responsive to stress from 1 to 6 pN. In live cells,
the mechanical force experienced by vinculin during cell migration
was mapped to reveal higher force in focal adhesions at the leading
edge of the cell compared with the trailing edge.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref278">278</xref></sup> This sensor variant was also optimized in subsequent studies
for use with VE-cadherin and PECAM1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref279">279</xref></sup> Tension sensors were developed using the 35-amino-acid-long villin
headpiece peptide (HP35) sandwiched between YPet and mCherry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref280">280</xref></sup> HP35 is an ultrafast-folding peptide that goes
through an equilibrium unfolding/folding transition in response to
mechanical forces of &#x0223c;7 pN, and a mutant version responds to
10 pN forces (HP35st). By incorporating either of these two peptides,
two different sensors were developed with response thresholds of 7
and 10 pN. The sensor was incorporated into Talin in an unstructured
linker region found between the head and rod domain of the protein
and used to characterize forces exerted on Talin during cell adhesion
and extracellular rigidity sensing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref280">280</xref></sup></p><p>Biosensor development benefits greatly from the diversity of imaging
approaches available to enable response quantification. For sensing
strain, Iwai and Uyeda made use of proximity imaging (PRIM) to develop
a strain biosensor called PriSSM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref281">281</xref></sup> PRIM
allows for the detection of distance based on spectral changes caused
by proximity between two FPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref282">282</xref></sup> In this
strain sensor, a 29-amino-acid-long flexible linker (AS(GGS)<sub>9</sub>) is incorporated between unmodified and circularly permuted GFP
(cp174GFP). Spectral changes between the two GFPs are probed (ratio
of emission at 490 over 390 nm) as mechanical strain is introduced
to the sensor and affects the inter-FP distance. The sensor was incorporated
between two motor domains of myosin II, and upon movement of the motor
domains, mechanical strain was introduced to the sensor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref281">281</xref></sup> This allowed for the sensing of small forces,
on the scale of several piconewtons. In another example of exploiting
diverse approaches to quantify biosensor response, Ren and colleagues
from the Berro lab generated a force sensor that took advantage of
protein condensation induced by force.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref283">283</xref></sup> Rather than quantifying fluorescence intensity, condensate formation
induced by force served as an indicator of force distribution in yeast.
Ren et al&#x02019;s biosensor includes dimeric coiled coils that unfold
to expose hydrophobic interaction surfaces upon exposure to forces
in the range of 2&#x02013;14 pN. These surfaces being exposed can induce
oligomerization, which can then lead to protein condensation. The
coiled-coil was inserted to Hip1R, a yeast protein present at endocytic
sites, and GFP was fused to the C-terminus. As the protein underwent
force, protein condensates were formed. Quantification of condensate
diameter and number of condensates per cell served as a readout of
force. Three FRET sensors were developed in 2016 incorporating 25-,
40-, and 50-amino-acid peptide repeats from spider silk to detect
a wider range of forces, with the shortest peptide having the widest
range of force sensing at 2&#x02013;11 pN.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref284">284</xref></sup> A subsequent study published the following year introduced a FRET-based
tension sensor reporting in the single-piconewton regime, called FL-TSM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref285">285</xref></sup> This sensor is sensitive to 3&#x02013;5 pN forces,
and incorporates a ferredoxin-like linker peptide that has a more
immediate response to forces above a certain threshold (&#x0223c;3
pN) to yield a &#x0201c;digital response&#x0201d;. This linker peptide
was sandwiched between the yellow-red FRET pair YPet and mCherry,
and the sensor was tested upon insertion into talin and multiplexed
with an orthogonal talin sensor incorporating mTFP1 and LSSmOrange
to validate the observed response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref285">285</xref></sup></p><p>Traditionally, tension sensors have been developed in an ad hoc
way. However, in 2018, a tunable tension sensor was developed and
tested in vinculin utilizing rational sensor design.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref286">286</xref></sup> A method was developed to predict sensor sensitivity <italic>in cellulo</italic> by characterizing existing sensors before and
after incorporating modifications to determine how sensor properties
change. The most important properties that defined the mechanical
sensitivity of tension sensors were identified to be the mechanical
properties and length of the tension sensing domain, the physical
separation between the two FP chromophores, and the relative orientation
of the two FPs. The physiological relevance of the range of force
sensing in most tension sensors (variable from 1&#x02013;11 pN) is
unclear, so LaCroix and colleagues also developed several Clover-mRuby2
incorporating sensors with unstructured polypeptide domains (of variable
lengths) that can be selected for use in different contexts based
on dynamic range, mechanical sensitivity, and extension or force-based
strain exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref286">286</xref></sup></p><p>There is still

Similar to tension sensors, biosensors for visualizing molecular crowding
incorporate flexible linkers between reporting units that deform in
response to molecular crowding and result in altered fluorescent readout.
For instance, a FRET-based molecular crowding sensor called CrGE was
developed in 2015 by incorporating a flexible domain comprising 2
&#x003b1;-helical peptides that undergo conformational changes between
an mCerulean and mCitrine FRET pair, with the monomerizing A206K mutation
incorporated to reduce dimerization/self-association.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref287">287</xref></sup> CrGE was characterized <italic>in vitro</italic> using Ficoll PM70 or polyethylene glycol (PEG) as the crowding agent,
as well as in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Increased FRET was observed
under high-crowding conditions. Importantly, CrGE is not sensitive
to small molecules, ions, or DNA. A newer generation of CrGE, named
CrGE2.3, was later developed by incorporating mEGFP and mScarlet-I
as the FRET pair.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref288">288</xref></sup> CrGE2.3 was used to
reveal age-dependent changes in organellar crowding in yeast and that
stability of crowding, rather than absolute crowding levels, was a
suitable predictor of lifespan in this model organism. The FPs in
CrGE2.3 had similar chromophore maturation kinetics, which made this
sensor more suitable for long-term imaging experiments, whereas the
original CrGE was limited to short-term imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref288">288</xref></sup></p><p>Another improved sensor for macromolecular crowding,
called CRONOS, was developed and used to look at changes in crowding
in membraneless organelles. CRONOS uses mNeonGreen and mScarlet-I
as the reporting unit and the same sensing unit as CrGE and can be
targeted to different membraneless organelles. For instance, CRONOS
was fused to NPM1, a protein that forms nuclear condensates containing
rRNA and proteins with arginine-rich linear motifs,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref289">289</xref></sup> and thereby targeted CRONOS to the nucleolus. Upon inhibition
of transcription or induction of environmental stress, molecular crowding
levels within the nucleolus were reduced, as sensed by CRONOS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref290">290</xref></sup></p><p>More recently, Joron and colleagues determined
that changes in
FP fluorescence lifetimes can be used to report on molecular crowding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref291">291</xref></sup> Specifically, certain monomeric FPs, including

polyethylene glycol PEG. Using this property, Joron and colleagues
tagged the histone protein HP1&#x003b1; with mCherry and measured changes
in fluorescence lifetime in early differentiated and undifferentiated

a transition to a less heterogeneous and less dense population of

open the door to multiplexed imaging applications to study the behavior

the context of cell biology, refers to the difference in electrical
potential across the plasma membrane caused by differences in the
intra- and extracellular concentrations of negatively and positively
charged ions. ATP-driven ion transporters actively maintain this charge
imbalance, leading to a slightly negative resting membrane potential,
or voltage, in all cells. In neurons and other electrically excitable
cells, extracellular signals acting on transmembrane ion channels
can trigger substantial changes in voltage, including action potentials
marked by sudden and transient membrane depolarization, that induce
downstream cellular signaling events.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref292">292</xref></sup> Voltage-dependent signals such as action potentials are exceptionally
important in neurobiology, as they are crucial to neuronal function.
Voltage sensors, often called genetically encoded voltage indicators
(GEVIs), are therefore frequently used in neuroscience to monitor
electrical potential across neuronal plasma membranes and directly
visualize neuronal activity.</p><p>GEVI design relies on many of the
same considerations that are important for fluorescent biosensors
overall. In general, GEVIs incorporate the reporting unit into a transmembrane
voltage-sensing protein which undergoes conformational changes in
response to membrane potential changes. The large majority of GEVIs
exhibit a decrease in fluorescence signal upon membrane depolarization.
Sensor performance thus relies greatly upon the sensitivity and performance
of the selected voltage-sensing units, as well as FP brightness. Additional
factors are at play for GEVIs, however. Because membrane potential
must be measured at the plasma membrane, GEVIs depend on robust plasma
membrane targeting to enhance their presence at this crucial site.
The first generation of GEVIs was severely hindered in performance
by their poor plasma membrane localization, which resulted in a large
proportion of voltage-insensitive fluorescence, confounding actual
readout of membrane potential changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref293">293</xref></sup> Methods to improve GEVI membrane localization are important to amplifying
their voltage-dependent responses. Membrane localization is also a
limiting factor in GEVI performance, as the quantity of biosensors
available at the membrane is controlled and therefore limits the signal
amplification that can be achieved by increasing sensor expression
at the membrane. As such, GEVI optimization is also greatly focused
on increasing the difference between the &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;off&#x0201d;
states of the biosensor to maximize amplitude and dynamic range. Furthermore,
because action potentials are very rapid, biosensor kinetics must
be equal to or faster than voltage transients occurring on milli-
or submillisecond time scales. Achieving rapid kinetics for voltage
biosensors has traditionally been a limitation in the field and is
an important consideration for optimizing voltage sensor performance.
In this context, the field has traditionally focused on several specific
aspects of GEVI development. Below, we will discuss two of the most

in 1997 when
Siegel and Isacoff developed FLaSH, a green voltage sensor wherein

biosensor called VSFP (voltage sensitive fluorescent protein). In
contrast to FLaSH, which incorporates the full-length Shaker channel,
VSFP consists of a minimal VSD from the Kv2.1 K<sup>+</sup> channel
fused to cyan and yellow FPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref302">302</xref></sup> A voltage-dependent

were severely limited, and optimization efforts focused on improving
dynamic range by incorporating brighter FPs to amplify the effect
of fluorescence change upon membrane depolarization. For instance,
in 2008, Tsutsui et al. generated a FRET-based GEVI named Mermaid<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref303">303</xref></sup> using new, coral-derived FPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref303">303</xref></sup> Mermaid uses the VSD from <italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic> voltage sensing phosphatase (Ci-VSP) coupled to the relatively pH-insensitive
green FP Umi-Kinoko (UKG) and the orange FP mKO as the FRET pair.
Mermaid yielded a greatly improved dynamic range, with a 40% emission

suggested a multistep conformational change in the VSD. Mermaid2 was
then developed in 2013 by replacing the FRET pair with CFP and YFP,
resulting in slightly improved dynamic range and &#x0201c;on&#x0201d;/&#x0201d;off&#x0201d;
kinetics (0.93 ms &#x0201c;on&#x0201d;, 10.3 ms &#x0201c;off&#x0201d;).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref304">304</xref></sup> Nevertheless, Mermaid2 incorporates the same
VSD as Mermaid, and thus exhibits a multistep conformational change
upon membrane depolarization that complicates the biosensor response.</p><p>Around the same time, Jin and colleagues from the Cohen and Pieribone
laboratories generated a single-color GEVI named ArcLight.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref295">295</xref></sup> ArcLight incorporates the VSD of Ci-VSP (CiVSD)
along with ecliptic pHluorin (pH-sensitive GFP variant, see <xref rid="sec4.1" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec4.1" ref-type="other">4.1</xref></xref>). Upon membrane
depolarization, much like other VSDs, Ci-VSD changes conformation,
and the FP inserted into the sensing domain undergoes changes in fluorescence
intensity (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>b). An A227D mutation unintentionally introduced to ecliptic pHluorin
resulted in improved dynamic range, which was further enhanced by
inserting the FP closer to S4 of in the CiVSD sensing domain. The
final ArcLight A242 variant exhibited a 35% fluorescence intensity
decrease in response to 100 mV depolarization in HEK293 cells. Despite
the high voltage sensitivity, ArcLight lacked the temporal resolution
necessary for spike detection (&#x0223c;10 ms reported response time).
Subsequent improved ArcLight variants were developed by introducing
mutations into the VSD to improve biosensor kinetics, including the
GEVI Bongwoori, which was able to resolve action potentials in neurons
with a reported response time of approximately 6&#x02013;7 ms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref298">298</xref></sup></p><p>Another family of VSD-based sensors is
the accelerated sensor of
action potentials (ASAP) family, which started with the development
of ASAP1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref305">305</xref></sup> In contrast to the aforementioned
designs, in which the reporting unit is inserted C-terminal to the
VSD, St-Pierre and colleagues from the Lin lab generated ASAP1 by
inserting cpGFP into the extracellular loop connecting helices S3
and S4. All VSDs are thought to undergo voltage-dependent conformational
changes in these regions, and the authors reasoned that inserting
the reporting unit here would lead to efficient conformational coupling.
Specifically, they used the VSD from <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> VSP, which has a shorter S3&#x02013;S4 extracellular loop compared
with CiVSD, and observed that the inserted cpGFP undergoes a loss
of fluorescence intensity in response to membrane depolarization.
ASAP1 was a great improvement in terms of response time, with on/off
kinetics of &#x0223c;2 ms, which is faster than other variants available
at the time, and the high brightness, dynamic range, and fast kinetics
of ASAP1 make it a preferred voltage biosensor in the field. Several
improved variants have been developed since the introduction of ASAP1.
The latest variant, ASAP4e, exhibits improved photostability and is
particularly notable for its large, positive response to membrane
depolarization. A single-color GEVI with a positive response has long
been sought after in the field, as depolarization-induced fluorescence
increases would allow more robust and reliable measurements of neuronal
activity. Reported in 2023 by Evans and colleagues from the Lin lab,
ASAP4e was generated by exhaustively screening mutations at two sites
within GFP to alter the chromophore H-bond network and invert the
response, followed by structure-guided mutation to tune the voltage
sensitivity and dynamic range. These efforts yielded a sensor with
a 210% fluorescence increase within the physiological voltage range,
along with high temporal resolution (activation kinetics of 2.6 ms
at room temperature). These properties of ASAP4e were harnessed to
achieve long-term <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of voltage and
Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in behaving mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref215">215</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec4.5.2"><label>4.5.2</label><title>Rhodopsin-based Voltage Biosensors</title><p>A second major class of GEVIs incorporates rhodopsin-based sensing

some of the limitations of the original sensor. For instance, early
engineering efforts were directed at eliminating the native proton-pumping
activity of Arch, which generates a photoinduced current that can
perturb endogenous membrane potential.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref309">309</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref311">311</xref></sup> Arch, which excites

GEVIs was established
with the development of electrochromic FRET (eFRET)-based GEVIs (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref></xref>d). This strategy
repurposes Arch as a voltage-sensitive FRET acceptor for another attached

a robust decrease in donor fluorescence intensity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref320">320</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref321">321</xref></sup> thus overcoming the intrinsically low brightness of Arch-based sensors.
The Cohen and Schnitzer laboratories introduced such eFRET sensors

4 new GEVIs by fusing QuasAr2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref310">310</xref></sup> to eGFP,
Citrine, mOrange2, or mRuby2. These sensors generated average intensity
decreases ranging from 7.7 to 13.1% following 100 mV membrane depolarization
in HEK293 cells. A citrine-Quasar2 fusion, named citrine-arch eFRET
sensor (CAESR), was also developed by Brinks and co-workers which,
with a calibration of membrane voltage to citrine lifetime, enabled
monitoring of absolute voltage using 2-photon FLIM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref322">322</xref></sup> Alternatively, Gong et al. used <italic>Leptosphaeria maculans</italic> (Mac) rhodopsin as the voltage sensor, which has a blue-shifted

voltage sensitivity, compared with Arch.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref323">323</xref></sup> The eFRET sensors MacQ-mCitrine and MacQ-mOrange2 were developed
by fusing mCitrine or mOrange2, respectively, to the Mac C-terminus.
Membrane depolarization from &#x02212;140 to 100 mV in cultured neurons
resulted in fast (&#x0223c;3 ms) responses and approximately 20% fluorescence
intensity changes. The rapid kinetics of the MacQ sensors are more
suitable for spike detection compared with VSD-based designs and have

to facilitate the sensing of ion concentration changes, including
the use of cpFPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref></sup> Subsequent innovations
in ion biosensor design have focused on improving the specificity
of the sensing units. Divalent metal cations are among the most biologically
relevant ions, and binding domains sensitive for one species may be
affected by several others. The ability to specifically discriminate
between ions is therefore a critical design consideration. There are
broadly two strategies for ion biosensor sensing units. In the first
approach, two peptide binding partners are used, whose affinity for
one another increases upon binding of the ion of interest. The resulting
conformational change then modulates the response of the reporting
unit. Typically, this is manifested as a change in either FRET between
two FPs (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>a, top) or the fluorescence intensity of
a single FP (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>a, middle). The other strategy leverages the intrinsic ion-binding
behavior exhibited by certain FPs, whereby ion binding directly changes
FP fluorescence properties (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>a, bottom). The ion binding region can then be engineered
to achieve higher affinity and specificity for the ion of interest

GECIs, the discovery and engineering of FPs that emit in the NIR region
has resulted in growing interest in developing IR biosensors. In 2019,
Qian and co-workers reported NIR-GECO1, which inserts CaM and the
CaM binding peptide into mIFP, generating a GECI that emits in the
NIR region.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref205">205</xref></sup> While NIR-GECO1 demonstrated
the power of an IR-emitting GECI, with improved tissue penetration
and multiplexing capability, it has several limitations, namely a
quenching or &#x0201c;turn off&#x0201d; response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulation
and a relatively small response compared to other GECIs. The more

GCaMP series have
also been optimized for improved kinetics and brightness to facilitate
imaging in neurons, where Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses quickly follow
action potentials. To this end, brighter sensors with greater dynamic
range, such as NCaMP7 and mNG-GECO1, both based on the brighter, <italic>Branchiostoma lanceolatum</italic>-derived fluorescent protein mNeonGreen,
have been developed for <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging applications,

which exhibited a dynamic range of over 400-fold as compared to 15.8-fold
for NCaMP7.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref348">348</xref></sup> While these sensors have
demonstrated the great improvements in brightness and dynamic range
that can be achieved with this novel FP, the latest generation of
GCaMP sensors, jGCaMP8s, GCaMP8f, and GCaMP8m, still show great improvements
in sensitivity and kinetics over their cpGFP-based predecessors. These
new GCAMP sensors exhibit comparable brightness to GCaMP7 and retain
superior off-kinetics versus mNG-GECO1, while the latter still has
greater molecular brightness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref196">196</xref></sup> Both of
these recently developed sensors highlight continued routes for evolution
of single-FP Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors: to continue directed evolution
for improved sensitivity and kinetics, primarily modifying the sensing

improved starting points for sensor development.</p></sec><sec id="sec5.1.3"><label>5.1.3</label><title>Applications in Absolute Calcium Ion Measurement</title><p>The growth of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors in the last couple of decades
has led to numerous improvements in the kinetics, sensitivity, and
response amplitude of GECIs. Alongside advances in these areas, however,
a new goal has been set: achieving improved absolute quantification
of Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in living systems. Absolute quantification
can already be accomplished using FRET-based sensors but requires
careful calibration and avoidance of photobleaching, as the two FPs
in a FRET sensor may bleach at different rates. On the other hand,
single-color intensiometric sensors are difficult to utilize for absolute
measurements, as intensity can vary with local sensor concentration
and illumination intensity. To remedy this, novel techniques that
leverage FP photophysics have been developed for absolute quantification
of analyte concentrations using single-color Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors.</p><p>In contrast to the apparent intensity of a fluorophore, which can
be strongly influenced by experimental factors such as probe expression
and excitation power, excited-state lifetime is an intrinsic property
that allows for absolute determination of fluorophore state. With
this in mind, Linden and colleagues recently developed Tq-Ca-FLITS,
an mTurquoise2-based single-FP Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor optimized specifically
for lifetime-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing. Tq-Ca-FLITS shows a 1.3
ns change in fluorescence lifetime in response to intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation using the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore ionomycin.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref201">201</xref></sup> The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-lifetime relationship was
determined <italic>in vitro</italic> and then applied to Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in subcellular compartments and organoids, using frequency-domain
FLIM. The relatively fast acquisition speeds of frequency-domain FLIM
enabled Ca<sup>2+</sup> monitoring with quantification during trans-endothelial
migration of leukocytes, with a time-resolution of around 13 s.</p><p>PEAQ (photochromism-enabled absolute quantification) biosensing
is a technique that leverages the photochromic behavior of a single-FP
based Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor (GCaMP6s-Q) to determine absolute Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in parallel with imaging Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics.
Collection of a PEAQ cycle for quantitative imaging involves image
acquisition at multiple wavelengths, turning fluorescence &#x0201c;on&#x0201d;
and &#x0201c;off&#x0201d; in a manner dependent on Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration.
While the method requires multiple acquisitions for each PEAQ cycle,
limiting temporal resolution, alongside careful <italic>in vitro</italic> calibration (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>c), it represents a unique alternative method for performing absolute
quantification using single-color biosensors while preserving an intensiometric
readout, rather than having to directly optimize or engineer probes
for lifetime imaging<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref349">349</xref></sup> That said, the
single-FP biosensor must still be carefully selected for PEAQ, as
this technique relies on the intrinsic photophysics of traditionally
intensiometric probes, specifically those that exhibit photoswitching
between a bright &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; state and a dim &#x0201c;off&#x0201d;
state when exposed to different illumination wavelengths (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>d). With careful
FP selection or probe design, however, this method can prove a powerful
way to measure absolute Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations with an intensiometric
sensor, as demonstrated with the recently described NEMO sensor, based
on mNeonGreen.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref348">348</xref></sup></p><p>Balancing temporal
resolution and absolute quantification is a

in understanding neuronal activity to know not just which cells are
exhibiting Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in real time, but to know which
cells or cell types have shown Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity previously,
or which cells have shown more Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity during a given

challenging to monitor in real time. In this case, a reporter of Ca<sup>2+</sup> dynamics is not sufficient, but rather, a Ca<sup>2+</sup><italic>integrator</italic> is desired, which records a history
of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses.</p><p>This brings about a unique class
of Ca<sup>2+</sup> reporter, CaMPARI, in which the photoconvertible

GECIs, CaMPARI exhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent changes in fluorescence
intensity, although it shows an inverse response, resulting in a decrease
in green fluorescence in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, unlike most
green GECIs. However, CaMPARI also displays the green-to-red photoconversion
behavior of mEos2 when exposed to violet light, but only in the presence
of Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Thus, a readout of red fluorescence can be used
to provide an integrated record of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling events
that occurred over the course of the experiment time, defined by violet
illumination. This integrator has since been modified to create CaMPARI2
in 2018, with the goal of reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent photoconversion
to improve contrast <italic>in vivo</italic>. The new CaMPARI2 was
demonstrated in mice and larval zebrafish. Additionally, antibodies
specific to the red form of CaMPARI2 were developed and validated
in immunohistochemical assays for Ca<sup>2+</sup> integration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref351">351</xref></sup> However, recent work by Das et al. has suggested
that the modifications made in generating CaMPARI2 resulted in not

CaMPARI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref352">352</xref></sup> This work suggests that CaMPARI2

first genetically encoded Zn<sup>2+</sup> sensors adopted FRET-based
designs, following the successful demonstration of these kinds of
scaffolds for Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensing. Three early scaffolds utilized
different sensing units, producing three &#x0201c;families&#x0201d;
of FRET-based Zn<sup>2+</sup> sensors: the ZinCh, CALWY, and ZapCY
(also including the ZifCY sensors) families.</p><p>In 2001, Jensen
and co-workers observed that FP dimerization increases in the presence
of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, leading them to design improved CFP-YFP FRET pairs
by engineering a higher-affinity Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding site on each
FP. This effort resulted in tighter binding of the two FPs and improved
FRET efficiency in the presence of Zn<sup>2+</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref355">355</xref></sup> While not directly yielding a Zn<sup>2+</sup> sensor, this
study laid the groundwork for what would become an early genetically
encoded zinc indicator (GEZI), ZinCh. The ZinCh sensor was developed
based on this strategy of building the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding domain
directly into both FPs, along with introducing a long flexible linker
between the FRET pair. This design would ensure the FPs started far
away, resulting in a low-FRET basal state, and producing a large FRET
change upon association, directly linked by Zn<sup>2+</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref356">356</xref></sup> This scaffold has since been adapted and improved
for greater Zn<sup>2+</sup> affinity and emission ratio change in
the eZinCh series, with eZinCh-2 exhibiting a &#x00394;<italic>R</italic>/<italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> of 4 and a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of &#x0223c;1 nM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref357">357</xref></sup> However, the
eZinCh sensors are prone to aggregation, demonstrated especially in

amenable to measuring organellar Zn<sup>2+</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref358">358</xref></sup></p><p>The CALWY class of Zn<sup>2+</sup> sensors leverages
two metal-binding
domains (Atox1 and WD4) tethered to a FRET pair by a long, flexible
linker. The sensor initially exists in a high-FRET state, unbound
to Zn<sup>2+</sup>, and then undergoes a conformational change upon
Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding that results in decreased FRET efficiency.
The scaffold was initially intended as a copper sensor but had significant
affinity for Zn<sup>2+</sup>. Upon engineering to improve this quality,
a FRET-based sensor with subnanomolar affinity for Zn<sup>2+</sup> was developed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref359">359</xref></sup> An enhanced version,
eCALWY, was subsequently produced that improved the FRET response
by using weakly associating, nonmonomeric FPs to stabilize the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-free high-FRET state. This modification resulted in a sensor
with slightly lower Zn<sup>2+</sup> affinity but a 2.4-fold emission
ratio change upon Zn<sup>2+</sup> binding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref360">360</xref></sup></p><p>The Palmer lab subsequently developed two closely related
families
of Zn<sup>2+</sup> biosensors, the ZifCY and ZapCY series of probes,
using FRET between cyan- and yellow-emitting FPs for reporting and
zinc-finger domains as the unimolecular sensing unit (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref></xref>b, bottom). ZifCY utilizes
the Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2</sub> zinc-finger domain from the mammalian

generating the ZapCY1 and ZapCY2 sensors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref207">207</xref></sup> This more sensitive sensor has been used for determining ER Zn<sup>2+</sup> levels. While ZifCY was unable to detect changes in Zn<sup>2+</sup> in the ER, the more sensitive ZapCY could do so, although
it was basally saturated when expressed in the cytosol. This contrast
illustrates the need to carefully tune biosensor affinity toward the
analyte of interest as well as the application of interest.</p><p>More recent work on FRET-based Zn<sup>2+</sup> biosensors has focused
on tuning the existing widely used eCALWY, ZapCY, and ZifCY scaffolds
either to improve the photophysics and achieve greater dynamic range
or to modify them specifically for subcellular Zn<sup>2+</sup> sensing.
The Palmer lab has improved the ZapCY series of sensors by replacing
the YFP acceptor with cpVenus, generating ZapCV. ZapCV2 additionally
exhibits a Zn<sup>2+</sup> affinity that allows it to be partially
saturated at rest in the cytosol of most mammalian cells, enabling
this sensor to detect both increases and decreases in Zn<sup>2+</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref363">363</xref></sup> ZapCV2 has subsequently been used

or decrease dimerization affinity and improve dynamic range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref365">365</xref></sup></p><p>Another axis of recent improvements lies
in organellar targeting

in organelles and vesicles remain difficult, in part because <italic>in situ</italic> calibration is nontrivial given that pH, which can
vary across cellular compartments, can also affect FP fluorescence.
Recent work by Pratt and co-workers addresses this problem in part
by using the acceptor FP in the FRET-based ZapCY1 and eCALWY-4 sensors

K<sup>+</sup> sensors available to biologists was expanded with the
development of the KIRIN1 and KIRIN1-GR sensors. However, while these

role this ion plays in signaling. Unlike many other ion biosensors,
halide sensors do not use separate sensing and binding domains but

learned to utilize molecules more complex
than ions to build cellular structures to support life and sense the
state of their rapidly changing environment. These molecules range
from simple compounds such as hydrogen peroxide, to more complex molecules
such as nucleotides and sugars, that carry out multifaceted functions
including acting as second messengers in signal transduction and energy
storage in metabolism. The concentrations of these molecules, broadly
referred to here as cellular analytes, are an indicator of organism
health, and dysregulation of their dynamics often leads to severe
diseases including cancer and diabetes. Owing to their critical roles
in various biological functions, these cellular analytes have been
a focus in biosensor development for several decades. Genetically
encoded fluorescent biosensors have unique advantages in monitoring
cellular analyte dynamics in real-time within their original biological
context, compared with other biochemical methods which often isolate
cellular analytes from their native environment. Across all cellular
analytes, a critical consideration for biosensor design is to identify
unique binding domains that can distinguish analytes of interest from
background molecules, including structurally related compounds, enabling
the resulting biosensor to faithfully report accurate changes and
reveal the true biological processes of interest. Because of the universality
of cellular analytes across different domains of life, the search
for an ideal binding domain has expanded to include both prokaryotes
and eukaryotes. Aside from binding domains, new FPs are also being
explored to obtain better sensors with improved dynamic range, sensitivity,
and spectral compatibility. Recent developments are discussed in more
detail in the following sections, for a variety of cellular targets.</p><sec id="sec6.1"><label>6.1</label><title>Cyclic Nucleotides</title><p>Cyclic nucleotides,

resulting in a &#x0201c;cyclic&#x0201d; bond arrangement. An important
biological function of cyclic nucleotides is their ability to relay
biological cues in signal transduction as second messengers in both

such approaches provide valuable information about total intracellular
cAMP levels, they obscure the native and dynamic behavior of free
intracellular cAMP, which plays a critical role in cAMP-dependent
cell signaling. Genetically encoded cAMP indicators were thus developed
to probe the dynamics of cAMP in live cells.</p><p>Typically, a cAMP
indicator is constructed based on the interaction between cAMP and
a cAMP-binding effector protein/domain, which acts as the sensing
unit. The two types of effectors most commonly used in designing cAMP
indicators are exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (EPACs)
and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). EPACs are a family of cAMP-regulated
proteins that act as guanine exchange factors (GEFs) for monomeric
GTPases such as Rap1 and Rap2. PKA is another cAMP-regulated effector
protein, which comprises a tetrameric holoenzyme containing a regulatory
subunit dimer bound to a pair of catalytic subunits. cAMP binding
to the PKA regulatory (PKA R) subunits promote activation and release
of the PKA catalytic (PKA C) subunit. Utilizing the cAMP-binding-induced
conformational changes in these proteins as the sensing unit, both
FRET-based and single-FP-based cAMP indicators have been constructed,
improved, and applied in various biological investigations (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>a).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Genetically encoded fluorescent indicators for detecting various

single-FP cAMP indicator, G-Flamp1. cGMP indicators are constructed
similarly to cAMP indicators, using a cGMP-specific binding domain

PtdIns-binding domain (e.g., PH domain from GRP1) inserted between
a FRET pair and can report changes in plasma membrane PtdIns levels
through changes in FRET. InPAkt (lower) utilizes the PH domain from
Akt and a negatively charged pseudoligand as a molecular switch to

newly available cyan-and yellow-emitting FPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref401">401</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref402">402</xref></sup> However, the responses from a bimolecular FRET reporter system can
be difficult to reliably quantify due to uneven expression of the
donor and acceptor components, restricting their broader application.
This problem was resolved by the concurrent introduction of several
unimolecular FRET-based cAMP indicators that use EPAC as the sensing
domain scaffold, which is sandwiched between a FRET pair. These sensors
contain either full-length EPAC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref403">403</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref404">404</xref></sup> or a truncated
cyclic nucleotide-binding domain (CNBD)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref405">405</xref></sup> as the sensing unit, which switches from a closed to a more open
conformation upon cAMP binding. This conformational change alters
the distance and orientation between the FRET pair, allowing changes
in FRET to reflect cAMP dynamics. Over the past 20 years, EPAC-based
designs have largely come to dominate the field of FRET-based cAMP
indicators.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref406">406</xref></sup> One exception comes from
the work of Surdo et al., who generated the unimolecular FRET-based
cAMP indicator cAMP universal tag for imaging experiments (CUTie)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref407">407</xref></sup> to address a common problem where subcellular
targeting can negatively impact biosensor sensitivity, making it difficult
to directly compare responses at different intracellular sites. To
overcome this problem, CUTie adopts an unconventional sensor configuration
in which YFP is inserted into the middle of a CNBD from type II&#x003b2;
PKA regulatory subunit and CFP is fused to the C-terminus. CUTie showed
almost identical response performance regardless of its localization
to different subcellular compartments, and was thus used as a &#x0201c;universal
tag&#x0201d; for imaging of various cAMP microdomains in cardiomyocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref407">407</xref></sup></p><p>The success and popularity of the Epac-based
cAMP indicators is
underscored by the continuous efforts that have been invested in making
these sensors better. For example, both EPAC1 and EPAC2 have been
used in cAMP indicator backbones, but sensors containing EPAC1 were
found to display significantly larger dynamic ranges and faster activation
kinetics in a side-by-side comparison.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref405">405</xref></sup> Different variants of the Epac-based sensors have also been developed
to improve their performance. For example, while full-length EPAC

unit, several advances in cAMP sensor
performance have been achieved by optimizing FP choice. For example,
early FRET-based cAMP indicators often used ECFP and EYFP as donor
and acceptor, respectively. However, both ECFP and EYFP are sensitive
to environmental factors such as pH or ions. When introduced into
excitable cells such as neurons or pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells, FP behavior,
especially EYFP brightness, was found to be affected by subtle changes
in pH and ion concentrations, generating biosensor artifacts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref416">416</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref417">417</xref></sup> To solve this problem, some groups opted to construct modified sensors
using Cerulean and Citrine, newer FPs that are less sensitive to environmental
changes, enabling more consistent measurement of cAMP concentrations
under various physiological conditions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref417">417</xref></sup> including better visualization of depolarization-induced cAMP elevations
in MIN6 cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref416">416</xref></sup> cAMP sensor performance
has frequently been improved by incorporating newer FPs with superior
properties. The third-generation Indicator of cAMP using EPAC (ICUE3)
replaced Citrine with cpVenus as the FRET acceptor, which not only
increased brightness but also reoriented the acceptor chromophore
to increase FRET efficiency and dynamic range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref411">411</xref></sup> mTurquoise2, one of the brightest and most photostable
cyan-emitting FPs available, has also been incorporated into new generations
of the Epac-S family of FRET-based cAMP indicators, along with another
innovation of using tandem copies of cpVenus as the FRET acceptor,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref409">409</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref418">418</xref></sup> a strategy that yielded some of the best-performing FRET-based cAMP
indicators available. The cleaner fluorescence lifetime decay of mTurquoise2
compared with other CFPs is also suitable for FLIM applications. This
has helped in the development of FLIM-FRET cAMP sensors, where dark
FRET acceptors are preferred to minimize spectral contamination of
the donor signal and allow more robust multiplexing, yielding sensors
with tandem dark cpVenus acceptors and large cAMP-induced lifetime
changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref409">409</xref></sup></p><sec id="sec6.1.1.1"><label>6.1.1.2</label><title>Single-FP-Based cAMP Indicators</title><p>The last 10 years have also seen rapid development of multiple single-FP
cAMP indicators. Many of these sensors exhibit greater responses than
FRET-based cAMP indicators and more readily allow for simultaneously
monitoring the dynamics of cAMP and other related signaling molecules,
such as PKA. The first single-FP cAMP indicator, Flamindo, was constructed
by inserting the CNBD of murine EPAC1 into the yellow-emitting FP
Citrine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1000">1000</xref></sup> cAMP binding to Flamindo induces
conformational changes near the FP chromophore that decrease fluorescence
intensity, which serves as a readout of cAMP dynamics. To increase
the brightness and dynamic range of this first-generation sensor,
Odaka et al. optimized the amino acid composition of the linkers joining
the EPAC CNBD to the Citrine &#x003b2;-barrel,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref419">419</xref></sup> specifically adding four amino acids (ALKK) to the N-terminal linker.
Compared to its parent, Flamindo2 showed 8-fold higher basal brightness,
along with a 2-fold dynamic range improvement. In contrast to Flamindo,
where the EPAC CNBD is inserted into Citrine, Tewson and colleagues
developed cAMP Difference Detector <italic>in situ</italic> (cADDis)
following a GCaMP-like design by inserting cpmNeonGreen between the
signaling and catalytic domains of EPAC2. As with Flamindo, binding
of cAMP to cADDis induces a conformational change that decreases mNeonGreen
fluorescence intensity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2000">2000</xref></sup> However, cADDis
is only available commercially and exhibits a relatively low affinity
for cAMP that may only be suitable for application under high-cAMP
conditions, both of which limit the wider use of this sensor. Single-FP
cAMP sensor-designs have also proven to be less reliant on EPAC than
FRET-based cAMP sensors. For example, in a design reminiscent of the
earliest cAMP sensors, Hackley et al. developed a PKA-based single-FP
cAMP indicator, cAMPr, by sandwiching cpGFP between the PKA C subunit
and a truncated fragment of PKA RI&#x003b1; (91&#x02013;244) containing
only one CNBD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref420">420</xref></sup> cAMPr shows a greatly
increased <italic>in vitro</italic><italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> for cAMP of 10 nM, compared with 1 &#x003bc;M for cADDis, along with
a broader linear dose response, extending the range of cAMP concentrations
that can be detected.</p><p>Red-shifted single-FP cAMP sensors are
also being developed to empower greater multiplexed imaging in various
conditions. In Pink Flamindo, for example, the mEPAC1-derived CNBD
used in Flamindo was further truncated and inserted into a red-emitting
FP mApple.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref421">421</xref></sup> A similar linker-engineering
approach to that used to obtain Flamindo2 was also applied to optimize
Pink Flamindo performance, yielding a &#x0003e;200% increase in red fluorescence
intensity in live cells upon cAMP elevation. Pink Flamindo is compatible
with blue-shifted sensors or optogenetic tools and was shown to be
effective in monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of cAMP generated
by photoactivated adenylyl cyclase (AC) in response to blue light,
as well as in dual-color imaging experiments with the green Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator G-GECO.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref421">421</xref></sup> Soon afterward,
Ohta et al. used an insertion-screening approach, where they inserted
cp146 mApple at various positions within the N-terminal CNBD of PKA
RI&#x003b1;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref422">422</xref></sup> The resulting sensor, named
R-FlincA, showed increased affinity and dynamic range compared with
Pink Flamindo, with a reported 8-fold maximum fluorescence intensity
increase upon cAMP addition <italic>in vitro</italic>, thus allowing
for easier detection of subtle cAMP changes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref422">422</xref></sup> Although cAMP sensors have been introduced into transgenic animal

regards to their dynamic range and response sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref425">425</xref></sup> Among these, the EPAC-S variant H187 (EPAC-S<sup>H187</sup>) stood out for its high dynamic range and fast response.
Like most Epac-based cAMP sensors, EPAC-S<sup>H187</sup> lacks the
N-terminal Dishevelled/Egl-10/Pleckstrin (DEP) domain that confers
PM localization<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref426">426</xref></sup> but retains an intact

the uneven cellular localization of EPAC-S<sup>H187</sup> by disrupting

small fluorescence changes, and many are dim when expressed in cells.
Overexpression of mammalian CNBD-containing proteins may also potentially
interfere with endogenous cAMP signaling. New efforts are thus being
aimed at generating sensors utilizing CNBDs from other species. For
example, using a bacterial cAMP receptor protein (CRP) with only around

a green fluorescent cAMP receptor protein-utilizing validated indicator

the previous results and illuminating a new way by which cAMP can

in the study of local cAMP signaling
is the development of Fluorescent Sensors Targeted to Endogenous Proteins

the POI via CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, such that spontaneous FP reconstitution

cAMP dynamics within these condensates to understand their role in
the spatiotemporal regulation of cAMP signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref415">415</xref></sup> The ability of cells to restrict cAMP elevations to discrete

guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) acts as a second messenger similar
to cAMP. cGMP regulates complex signaling cascades through immediate
effectors such as protein kinase G (PKG), PDEs, and cyclic nucleotide-gated
ion channels. It plays a central role in diverse physiological and
pathological conditions, including vascular smooth muscle relaxation
and retinal phototransduction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref439">439</xref></sup> Currently
used cGMP sensors are based on the cGMP binding domains from two proteins:
cGMP-dependent protein kinase I (PKGI/cGKI) and PDE5. The general
design strategy is the same as that for cAMP indicators, with binding
of cGMP to the sensing unit resulting in a change in fluorescence
intensity or emission ratio. The most widely used cGMP sensors follow
a FRET-based design. The cGMP binding domain is flanked by CFP and
YFP; binding of cGMP induces a conformational change in the sensor,
thus altering FRET efficiency. The first FRET-based cGMP sensor, CGY-del1,
utilized truncated PKGIalpha (delta 1&#x02013;47), which removes the
dimerization sequence, as the sensing unit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref440">440</xref></sup> Further mutation of the catalytic domain (T516A) silenced the intrinsic
kinase activity of PKGI within the sensor, resulting in the cygnet
series of cGMP indicators. These sensors reversibly responded to cGMP
levels stimulated by nitric oxide (NO) in RFL fibroblasts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref441">441</xref></sup> Optimization of the FP pair and linker sequences

binding domain (cGNBD) also provides a way to engineer cGMP sensors
suitable for specific applications. To probe low cGMP levels in cells
such as cardiomyocytes and stellate ganglion (SG) neurons, the cGNBD
from PKG of the protozoan parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> (PfPKG) was sandwiched between CFP/Venus and T-Sapphire/Dimer2 FRET
pairs to generate yellow PfPKG and red PfPKG, respectively. Both sensors
showed similarly high affinities for cGMP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref449">449</xref></sup></p><p>An important development in cGMP imaging has been the generation
of transgenic mice expressing cGMP sensors. For example, transgenic
mice have been engineered using the cGi series of FRET-based cGMP
indicators, which comprise the tandem cGNBD of cGKI flanked by CFP
and YFP. In accordance with their tuned cGMP affinities, the sensors
are named cGi-500, cGi-3000, and cGi-6000 (for cGMP indicator with
an EC50 of 500, 3000, and 6000 nM, respectively). This wide range
of cGMP-binding affinities allows the detection of physiologically
relevant cGMP changes for various cell types in transgenic mice. Cells
isolated from these transgenic mice were used to study cGMP dynamics
under various conditions, revealing important roles of cGMP in different
cardiovascular cell types.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref443">443</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref450">450</xref></sup> A transgenic mouse

been developed, such as
FlincG, which directly fuses a cGNBD derived from PKG to cpEGFP. cGMP
binding to the regulatory domain of PKG induces substantial conformational
changes. FlincG was shown to successfully detect changes in cGMP levels
in HEK293T cells and cardiac fibroblasts, but not in other cells such

of rational mutations from the original FlincG also yielded improved
cGMP indicators, FlincG2 and FlincG3, which showed 230-fold selectivity
over cAMP, although they showed lower affinity for cGMP, suggesting
they are preferable in applications where higher cGMP concentration
is observed.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref453">453</xref></sup> In an effort to improve
upon the labor-consuming trial-and-error approach that is typically
used for sensor optimization, a computational method was developed
that effectively combines modeling techniques with coarse-grained

led to the development of an improved cGMP sensor, CUTie2. The sensor

is straightforward to use FP-labeled phosphoinositide-binding proteins
as indicators to examine the localization of phosphoinositides (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref></xref>b). Generally, phosphoinositide

by the differential binding affinities of different binding domains
for different phosphoinositides. Several highly specific phosphoinositide-binding
proteins have been used to examine the localization of endogenous
phosphoinositides. For example, a GFP-labeled FYVE domain showed that
PI(3)P was predominantly localized to endosomes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref462">462</xref></sup> whereas PI(4)P was shown to exhibit a wider distribution,
including to the Golgi, plasma membrane, and endosome/lysosome, according
to a GFP-labeled P4M domain derived from the bacterial pathogen-secreted

on the spatial distribution of these important molecules.</p></sec><sec id="sec6.2.2"><label>6.2.2</label><title>FRET-Based Phosphoinositide Indicators</title><p>While translocation-based phosphoinositide sensors have the ability
to localize to native compartments, there are some drawbacks to their
use: first, intensity fluctuations caused by drifting of the focal
plane or changes in cell morphology can drastically affect quantification
of probe fluorescence, which may lead to inaccurate conclusions; second,
some lipid-binding domains may localize to certain regions of the
cell in a lipid-independent manner; third, these sensors cannot be
targeted subcellularly to study specific pools of phosphoinositides.
To overcome some of these limitations, FRET-based phosphoinositide
sensors have been developed. A PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> biosensor used
cotranslocation as the sensing mechanism and FRET changes as the readout
to detect changes in membrane PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels. In this
bimolecular design, PH<sub>PLC&#x003b4;1</sub> was fused to either CFP
or YFP, with domains fused to either FP being coexpressed in cells
and bound to the plasma membrane PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Upon decreases
in membrane PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels caused by PLC-mediated conversion
to IP<sub>3</sub> and DAG, both CFP-PH<sub>PLC&#x003b4;1</sub> and YFP-PH<sub>PLC&#x003b4;1</sub> are released from the plasma membrane, decreasing
the proximity of CFP and YFP and causing a change in intermolecular
FRET.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref468">468</xref></sup> Although the FRET-based readout
addressed some of the limitations in quantification, this sensor still
uses a translocation-based reporting mechanism and thus cannot be
targeted subcellularly. In addition, the expression levels of the
two FP-tagged PH domains must be carefully optimized to achieve the
desired sensitivity, although a unimolecular version, named CYPHR,
was constructed by both linking CFP and YFP to a single PH domain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref469">469</xref></sup></p><p>To fundamentally address the limitations
of translocation-based biosensors, another series of phosphoinositide
sensors use a FLLIP design (fluorescent indicator for a lipid second
messenger that can be tailor-made), which contain a membrane targeting
motif, phosphoinositide-binding domain and hinge linking the FRET
FP pair. The sensor PH domain binds or releases the membrane depending
on the presence of the corresponding phosphoinositide, inducing a
conformational change that drags the FRET pair into or out of proximity
and altering FRET.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref470">470</xref></sup> This method has been
applied to design the Pippi sensor series for probing PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref471">471</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref472">472</xref></sup> This design
requires targeting the sensor to the membrane compartment of interest

The InPAkt (Indicator of Phosphoinositides using Akt) FRET biosensor
that detects cellular PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> and PI(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, collectively known as 3-phosphoinositides (3-PIs), introduced a
pseudoligand into the design to constitute a molecular switch with
the PH domain. The pseudoligand sequence is designed to bind with
low affinity to the PH domain in the basal state and be competed off
when the specific phosphoinositide is generated and binds the PH domain
instead. This competitive binding causes a global conformational change
in the sensor, leading to a change in FRET.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref473">473</xref></sup> In NIH3T3 cells, PDGF triggered immediate and transient production
of 3-PIs at the plasma membrane, as revealed by plasma membrane-targeted
InPAkt. Nuclear-localized InPAkt, however, showed no response, despite
the presence of nuclear Akt activity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref473">473</xref></sup> suggesting that a pool of Akt can disassociate from the plasma membrane
and translocate to the nucleus. More recently, 3-PIs were found to
also accumulate on the lysosome membrane through endocytosis to locally
activate the downstream Akt/mTOR pathway.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref474">474</xref></sup> The pseudoligand design pioneered by InPAkt has since been applied
to detect other 3-PIs. For example, by pairing PH<sub>PLC&#x003b4;1</sub> with the InPAkt pseudoligand sequence, Hertel et al. generated the

in live cells. Peredox is an example of this type of sensor, which
uses the bacterial NADH-binding protein Rex fused to cpT-Sapphire,
an LSS green-emtting FP, and mCherry to enable ratiometric imaging.
NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH compete for binding to the sensor, and this

FP, Zhao and colleagues observed the sensor to be relatively insensitive
to pH changes from 7.0 to 7.8 when the sensor was excited with 420
nm light, as well as negligible effect of pH changes from 7.0 to 8.0

This family was designed using the T-Rex domain from SoNar, to which
Tao and colleagues introduced mutations to alter the charges of amino
acids in the NADP-binding loop, reduce loop rigidity, and increase
the polarity of the adenine binding pocket to make it sensitive to
NADPH over NADH. The cpYFP reporting design was retained from SoNar,
and after structure-guided engineering, excitation-ratiometric NADPH
sensors were developed. The sensors were validated for imaging of

core difference in this system as compared to the dLight scaffold
is that instead of replacing the entire intracellular loop, the GRAB

involved in a wide variety of cellular processes in many cell types.
These receptors are common drug targets, making up nearly a third
of the drug market, and so understanding of their function and activation
is crucial but is complicated by the numerous receptor types and varied
downstream effectors. GPCR signaling occurs through multiple stages,
beginning with ligand binding or another activating signal that leads
to a conformational change in the receptor. Heterotrimeric G-proteins,
consisting of G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>, G<sub>&#x003b2;</sub>, and G<sub>&#x003b3;</sub> subunits, bound to the receptor then change in response
to receptor activation. The G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> subunit, which can
come in several types including G<sub>&#x003b1;s</sub>, G<sub>&#x003b1;i</sub>, G<sub>&#x003b1;q</sub>, and G<sub>&#x003b1;12</sub>, binds GTP and
becomes active in response to GPCR activation, while the G<sub>&#x003b2;/&#x003b3;</sub> dimer dissociates from G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>, leading to downstream
signaling. Some GPCRs undergo additional changes during signaling.
Some receptors oligomerize, and still others bind to beta-arrestins
and undergo subsequent internalization. In biosensors of GPCR activity,
there are a few common strategies, divided by what aspect of GPCR
signaling is being directly reported: conformational change and ligand
binding (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref></xref>a), G-protein recruitment (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref></xref>b), or &#x003b2;-arrestin recruitment

between the GPCR and the recruited G-protein leads to increased FRET.

produces bioluminescence in the presence of substrate. Upon recruitment
of &#x003b2;-arrestin to an activated GPCR, the luminescence signal
is quenched due to the occurrence of BRET between the luciferase and
a membrane-targeted acceptor FP, leading to increased fluorescence.

changes within the receptor as the molecular switch are generated
by incorporating FPs at the site(s) of the greatest conformational
change. This is generally between transmembrane domains (TMs) 5 and
6, which are linked by IL3. In FRET-based sensors, one FP will often
be fused to the receptor C-terminal tail and a second inserted within
or even entirely replacing IL3 (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10</xref></xref>a). Alternatively, in a single-FP sensor,
a cpFP can be inserted into or replace IL3. Similarly, GPCR-based
sensors that report ligand binding are often more directly reporting
the conformational change that occurs upon ligand binding. This is
the design rationale behind the GPCR-based neurotransmitter biosensors,
which are covered in <xref rid="sec7.1" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec7.1" ref-type="other">7.1</xref></xref>. In this section, we will thus focus more on those
GPCR sensors intended to report directly on conformational changes,
with the goal of sensing GPCR activity rather than ligand dynamics.</p><p>One of the most common targets of conformational change-based GPCR
sensors are adrenergic receptors. Early examples of FP-based sensors
for ligand-induced conformational change are a FRET-based probe for
&#x003b1;<sub>A2</sub>AR activity, along with a second sensor for monitoring
parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHR) activation developed in the same
study. These sensors incorporated CFP inserted into IL3 and YFP appended
at the C-terminus. The development of these sensors revealed that
receptor activation occurs on a much faster time scale than had been
previously assumed, in addition to identifying the conformational
changes associated with agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists
of these receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref575">575</xref></sup></p><p>Another frequently
used platform for developing FRET-based reporters
of GPCR conformational change is the systematic protein affinity strength
modulation (SPASM) scaffold. In this system, a C-terminal peptide
fragment from a G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> subunit of interest is fused to
an FP (FRET donor), with a second FP (FRET acceptor) fused to the
receptor C-terminal tail. The G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> peptide-FP fusion
is tethered to the GPCR-FP chimera by a flexible linker, such that
when the GPCR undergoes a conformational change, the G&#x003b1; peptide
inserts into a groove between the transmembrane domains, bringing
the FP pair into proximity and resulting in a FRET ratio increase.
This strategy was initially demonstrated with the &#x003b2;2AR, along
with &#x003b1;2 and &#x003b1;1ARs, as well as being expanded to opsin-G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref576">576</xref></sup> While the SPASM strategy

activation, which first involves association of the G<sub>q</sub> heterotrimer,
followed by dissociation of the G<sub>&#x003b1;</sub> and G<sub>&#x003b2;/&#x003b3;</sub> subunits.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref577">577</xref></sup></p><p>Another approach uses

GPCR of interest, and strand 10 fused to the N-terminus of &#x003b2;-arrestin.
This assay exhibits very low background, even lower than traditional
BiFC assays, because strands 1&#x02013;9 will not reconstitute with
either strand 11 or 10 alone but only with both strands when they

cleave peptide bonds and lead to the
breakdown of proteins within the cell, and are thus critical for numerous
biological processes, including cell death, cancer proliferation,
and viral infectivity. For this reason, the ability to monitor protease
activity in real-time is important for understanding these processes.
To better understand how protease function ties into broader biological
pathways in health and disease, several biosensors of protease activity
have been developed over the years using numerous strategies. Many
of the earliest and most numerous sensors were designed to detect
caspase activity as a method to investigate the processes associated
with that family of proteases, namely, autophagy, apoptosis, and other
cell death mechanisms. However, the biological targets in the field
of protease biosensing have expanded in recent years, with a particular
focus on viral function and infectivity, especially in the wake of
the COVID-19 pandemic, as protease function is crucial for SARS-CoV2
function.</p><p>SARS-CoV2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, relies
on its protease
M<sup>Pro</sup>, also known as 3CL<sup>Pro</sup>, for its life cycle
and host immune evasion. Thus, it is a highly sought-after target
of potential antiviral drugs to deal with future COVID outbreaks.
Assays of M<sup>Pro</sup> activity are crucial both for understanding
viral protease function and in drug discovery efforts to identify
relevant protease inhibitors. Much of the last several years of work
on protease biosensor development and improvement has been driven
by the need to have a greater understanding of these viral proteases,
and so it would be remiss not to include a small selection of that
work here.</p><sec id="sec9.1"><label>9.1</label><title>RET-Based Protease Sensors</title><p>Many of
the earliest protease biosensors, like many other classes of biosensor,
were FRET-based probes. One of the earliest examples comes from Roger
Tsien&#x02019;s lab and began as a proof-of-concept for FRET between
FPs. Energy transfer was demonstrated through the trypsin- and enterokinase-mediated
cleavage of a linker between GFP and BFP, resulting in the sensor
transitioning from a high-FRET to a low-FRET state after protease
cleavage (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref></xref>a).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref594">594</xref></sup> This demonstration
laid the groundwork for a general scaffold to monitor protease activity
in living cells. The conceptual framework of this original sensor
was adapted into Atg4 sensors, to determine if there was a clear role
for Atg4 in autophagy. Different cyan-yellow FRET sensors were developed
with two different cleavage systems that work as different substrates
for different isoforms of Atg4. While these sensors did not demonstrate
an increase in activity for either isoform during autophagy, they
do set a promising precedent for the use of FRET-based protease activity
sensors in high-throughput screening assays, as they were assessed
to have favorable <italic>Z</italic>-scores.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref595">595</xref></sup> While FRET-based probes for protease activity have not been developed

incorporating hGluc and tdTomato as a BRET pair to report on enterokinase
activity with good tolerance for pH variability and buffer composition.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref596">596</xref></sup> This BRET-based scaffold has been enhanced

(discussed in <xref rid="sec3.1" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec3.1" ref-type="other">3.1</xref></xref>). This property has been leveraged to detect protease activity,
as upon cleavage of a linker, a ddFP could diffuse away from its partner
protein and lead to a substantial fluorescence change (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref></xref>b). Ding and co-workers reported
that green and red ddFPs could associate with the same partner protein
to induce fluorescence, and this flexibility enabled the development
of fluorescent protein exchange, FPX. In the FPX strategy for examining
caspase activity, a green ddFP and partner protein were tethered by
a cleavable DEVD sequence. Upon induction of caspase activity, the
linker becomes cleaved, allowing the partner protein to diffuse away
from the green ddFP and competitively associate with the red ddFP.
This system also enabled the development of a protease-dependent translocation
assay. However, FPX is limited to qualitative assessments of caspase
activity and association, due to differential affinities for the dimerization
partner protein with red and green ddFPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref600">600</xref></sup> Using only a single type of ddFP removes the difficulty in quantification,
and thus ddFPs have been used to quantitatively assess protease activity,

Intein-Based Sensors</title><p>Single-color protease reporters follow
a different design strategy compared to many other single-color biosensors,
since they must report activity, and the activity of a protease necessitates
splitting something apart. To this end, a number of fluorogenic strategies
have been developed for protease sensing, many based on a split-GFP
scaffold (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref></xref>c). This basic scaffold involves splitting GFP and tethering the
missing strand in such a way that protease activity is required to
release the tethered &#x003b2;-strand to enable GFP reconstitution.</p><p>An early example of this strategy is a split-GFP and split-intein
caspase reporter developed by Sakamoto and co-workers. In this design,
a fragment of a split-GFP is included in a split-intein, along with
a DEVD caspase cleavage substrate sequence. After translation, the
split-intein will be spliced to produce a cyclized GFP fragment, held
in the cyclized conformation by the DEVD sequence. When caspase activity
occurs in apoptotic cells, the DEVD substrate sequence is cleaved,
allowing the GFP fragment to uncyclize, enabling reconstitution of
the split-GFP and producing fluorescence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref603">603</xref></sup> This and other early split-GFP based reporters showed low fluorogenicity <italic>in vivo</italic> in systems such as zebrafish. To remedy this deficiency,
To and co-workers developed a novel strategy for a fluorogenic split-GFP,
which they termed ZipGFP. In this design, the 11th strand is separated
from GFP1-10 by two coiled-coil motifs connected by a TEV protease
substrate sequence. In response to TEV (or later, other protease)
activity, the substrate sequence is cleaved and the 11th strand &#x0201c;unzipped&#x0201d;,
enabling FP reconstitution and fluorescence.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref604">604</xref></sup> Further improvements to this scaffold were made with a successor
sensor from the same lab, termed FlipGFP. The crucial design improvement
relative to the previous ZipGFP was repositioning the split 11th strand
from an antiparallel to a parallel orientation, which was still locked
in place by the heterodimerizing coiled coils. Switching to a parallel
orientation prevents any fluorescence in the uncleaved form, lowering
background and increasing fluorescence turn-on. Once protease activity
occurs, the parallel 11th strand gains the conformational flexibility
to &#x0201c;flip&#x0201d; back around to an antiparallel configuration
and reconstitute the GFP (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">11</xref></xref>d). In an initial demonstration using TEV protease,
this method achieved a 77-fold fluorescence increase upon protease
treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref605">605</xref></sup></p><p>FlipGFP in particular
has found numerous applications for examining
SARS-CoV2 protease activity since its publication. Froggatt and co-workers
used the scaffold to design a protease assay for M<sup>Pro</sup> that
would be amenable to future high-throughput screens. With this assay,
they determined that inhibition of protease activity as reported correlated
with lowered infectivity in their model, supporting M<sup>Pro</sup> as a therapeutic target.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref606">606</xref></sup> FlipGFP has
also been used to develop an assay for screening known and putative
antiviral drugs against M<sup>Pro</sup> to identify possible therapies
for SARS-CoV2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref607">607</xref></sup></p><p>While most single-FP
protease sensors are based on a split-GFP
strategy, To et al. utilized rational design of a bacterial phytochrome
infrared FP to generate a fluorogenic protease sensor platform, termed
iProtease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref608">608</xref></sup> This strategy involved circular
permutation of an infrared FP and insertion of a protease cleavage
sequence as a spacer between the biliverdin-binding site and a cysteine
critical for the incorporation of biliverdin to the FP. In the presence
of the relevant protease, the spacer sequence is cleaved, resulting
in infrared fluorescence. While the sensor itself is a single FP,
a split GFP is used to ensure the cleaved cp-iFP remains together,
as well as to provide a transfection control and green fluorescence
signal for normalization of infrared fluorescence turn-on. This iProtease
strategy was demonstrated with TEV protease (iTEV) and caspase (iCasper)
and has since been adapted to report granzyme B activity. Kula and
co-workers utilized granzyme B activity as a readout of T-cell activation,
and thus the iProtease scaffold was adapted to generate IFP<sup>GZB</sup> and the TScan method to screen for T-cell epitopes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref609">609</xref></sup> This has recently been further expanded to
develop TScan-II, an improved and expanded version of the platform

of reversible phosphorylation in cells, protein
kinases, as the enzymes responsible for catalyzing the phosphoryl-transferase

by researchers. The human kinome includes over 500 kinases that are
grouped into more than 8 families and 13 atypical families based on
sequence homology within their catalytic domains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref611">611</xref></sup> Protein kinases are crucial components in cellular signal
transduction pathways, in which phosphorylation of various substrates
alters protein function and regulates cell behavior, dysregulation

including cancer, diabetes, and cardiac diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref612">612</xref></sup> Understanding the dynamics of protein phosphorylation by
protein kinases is thus crucial for developing therapeutic approaches
targeting these key signaling nodes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref613">613</xref></sup> Western blot or immunofluorescence assays are often used to study
kinase activity, but neither method is able to capture the full biological
context of dynamic kinase signaling, as they lack the high spatiotemporal
resolution that can be achieved by live-cell imaging approaches. Genetically
encoded kinase activity biosensors overcome the limitations of traditional
biochemical methods and are capable of monitoring kinase activity
or activation in the native cellular environment, making them favorable
tools to dissect kinase signaling pathways.</p><p>Depending on the
components of the sensing unit, kinase biosensors
can be defined as kinase activity reporters (KARs) or activation biosensors.
KARs act as surrogate substrates, employing a specific substrate sequence
that can be phosphorylated by the endogenous kinase of interest (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref></xref>a). The substrate is typically linked to a phosphoamino-acid
binding domain (PAABD), with the introduction of a negatively charged
phosphate group inducing binding between the substrate and PAABD,
resulting in a conformational change that reflects kinase activity.
Kinases also often possess critical regulatory sites susceptible to
post-translational modifications, which often modulate kinase activity
by directly altering the conformation of the kinase itself. Kinase
biosensors that incorporate the full-length or part of the kinase
utilize this conformational change to reflect the activation process
or state of the kinase, and thus are defined as &#x0201c;activation
sensors&#x0201d; (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">12</xref></xref>b). Different readouts can then be used to quantify the sensor
response, such as FP translocation, FRET, or spectral changes in a
single FP, depending on the configuration of the reporting unit. Such
varied strategies have enabled the development of biosensors for much
of the mammalian kinome, although further advancements are still necessary

by the design of Cameleon (see <xref rid="sec5.1.1" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec5.1.1" ref-type="other">5.1.1</xref></xref>), the very first PKA activity sensor,
or A-kinase activity reporter (AKAR), was engineered as a four-part
chimeric protein consisting of a FRET donor (ECFP), a 14&#x02013;3&#x02013;3&#x003c4;
domain, a PKA consensus phosphorylation sequence and a FRET acceptor
(Citrine). In this design, phosphorylation of the substrate by PKA
triggers binding to 14&#x02013;3&#x02013;3&#x003c4;, inducing a conformational
change that alters FRET between ECFP and Citrine. Different PKA substrate
sequences, based on the <italic>in vitro</italic> &#x0201c;kemptide&#x0201d;
substrate, were tested, and the best performer was designated AKAR1.
Diffusible AKAR1 showed a maximum yellow/cyan emission ratio change
of 40% in response to cellular cAMP elevation, and subcellularly targeting
AKAR1 to different compartments or microdomains revealed distinct
kinetics, implying an important role for spatial compartmentation
in PKA signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref615">615</xref></sup> This initial design

activity reporters (CKAR and AktAR) have been generated to study the
spatiotemporal regulation of these signaling enzymes. Based on this
first generation of sensors, many optimizations have been performed
to improve KAR performance for various experimental purposes. For
example, replacing the 14&#x02013;3&#x02013;3&#x003c4; domain of AKAR1
with a forkhead-associated 1 (FHA1) domain, which recognizes phophorylated
peptides with relatively weaker affinity, yielded a second-generation
AKAR (AKAR2) whose response could be effectively reversed by cellular
phosphatases, enabling faithful reporting of dynamic PKA activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref620">620</xref></sup> Taking advantage of enhanced CFP and YFP variants

a cell-type-dependent manner, implying the fine-tuning of Akt activity
with nanometer-scale spatial precision.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref623">623</xref></sup></p><p>Additionally, when selecting the FRET pair in kinase reporters,
more red-shifted FPs are preferable, as on the one hand, blue light
can cause greater phototoxicity to the cell and red light enables
less scattering and deeper penetration, which is favorable for applying
sensors <italic>in vivo</italic>; on the other hand, red-shifted reporters
will allow more spectral space for multiplexed imaging or blue light-enabled
optogenetic tools. For example, such a red-shifted AKAR was developed
utilizing the NIR-FPs miRFP670 and miRFP720 as the FRET donor and
acceptor, respectively, making it suitable for multiplexed imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref624">624</xref></sup> Along with the development of red-shifted FPs,
2P microscopy is increasingly being applied as an alternative approach
to achieve deeper tissue penetration for <italic>in vivo</italic> biosensor
imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref625">625</xref></sup> This technique leverages the
process of multiphoton absorption, where fluorescence is excited by
the absorption of two (or more) long-wavelength photons that reach
the fluorophore almost simultaneously (i.e., within &#x0003c;1 fs). However,
the broad 2P absorption and poorly understood 2P photobleaching behavior
of most FPs makes it challenging to implement 2P microscopy for ratiometric
FRET measurements.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref626">626</xref></sup> Instead, sensor responses
are typically visualized by FLIM-FRET imaging (see <xref rid="sec2.2.2.2" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec2.2.2.2" ref-type="other">2.2.2.2</xref></xref>), which
is largely insensitive to probe intensity and where only donor fluorescence
needs to be measured. However, the FP choice for the FRET pair should
be tested specifically in order to maximize compatibility with 2pFLIM.
In particular, several properties of the donor fluorophore need to
be taken into account, including the 2P cross-section, which determines
the efficiency of 2P absorption for a given fluorophore, as well as
both the donor lifetime length and decay kinetics, as a long donor
lifetime with a monoexponential fluorescence decay is the most desirable
for FLIM. Following these principles, 2pFLIM-compatible AKARs have
been developed and used to image PKA activity in response to neuromodulatory
inputs and during synaptic plasticity in acute brain slices<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref627">627</xref></sup> as well as to visualize <italic>in vivo</italic> neuromodulatory PKA activity in the brains of awake mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref628">628</xref></sup> More recently, PKA activity was imaged at cellular
resolution in the striatum of behaving mice for the first time, revealing
that two important neuromodulators, dopamine and adenosine, play opposing
roles and form a &#x0201c;push&#x02013;pull&#x0201d; system that acts
through PKA to balance the direct and indirect striatal pathway to
control &#x0201c;go and no-go&#x0201d; locomotor decisions in animals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref629">629</xref></sup></p><p>A single-FP-based KAR design has also
been developed that achieves
extremely high dynamic range and sensitivity compared with FRET-based
KARs. This design was initially applied to develop a single-FP AKAR,
where cpGFP is inserted between the established PKA substrate and
FHA1 domain. The resulting sensor displays reciprocal changes in fluorescence
intensity at two excitation wavelengths, such that changes in the
excitation ratio (e.g., excitation-ratiometric AKAR, or ExRai-AKAR)
reflect changes in PKA activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref></sup> ExRai-AKAR
showed very sensitive responses to PKA activity changes, along with
a much higher dynamic range and an improved SNR compared to the FRET-based
PKA reporters. Additional single-FP AKARs with different spectral
profiles were also generated by swapping cpGFP for cpT-Sapphire or
cpBFP, providing more options for multiplexed imaging experiments.
A second-generation sensor (ExRai-AKAR2) was later obtained by optimizing
the linker sequences on either side of cpGFP via high-throughput screening
(see section 3.4.2), which was capable of detecting extremely subtle
changes in PKA activity in the brains of awake mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref213">213</xref></sup> As with the modular design of FRET-based AKAR, the ExRai-AKAR
design has been generalized to construct single-FP sensors for both
PKC (ExRai-CKAR) and Akt (ExRai-AktAR).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref474">474</xref></sup> Optimization
of ExRai-AktAR subsequently allowed for investigation of subcellular
Akt activity on the lysosome surface, revealing an important role
for lysosomally localized 3-PIs in regulating growth factor-induced
localized Akt signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref474">474</xref></sup></p><p>A major
gap in the single-FP KAR toolkit is the notable lack of
red-shifted sensors because intrinsic differences in many properties
and characteristics of GFP and RFP pose a challenge to simply swapping
cpRFPs for cpGFP. However, alternative designs can also be pursued
to develop red-shifted single-color KARs. For example, an intensiometric
red AKAR has previously been developed using ddRFP as the reporting
unit.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref></sup> In addition, single-color KARs
have been developed based on homo-FRET (see <xref rid="sec2.2.2.2" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec2.2.2.2" ref-type="other">2.2.2.2</xref></xref>) to supplement the
multiplexed imaging toolkit. These sensors take advantage of changes
in the polarization of fluorescence emission that occur during FRET
to report biosensor conformational change and thus do not require
the donor and acceptor to have distinct fluorescence spectra (e.g.,
CFP and YFP). Instead, the donor and acceptor can be the same FP,
such as mCherry. Such FLuorescence Anisotropy REporters (FLAREs) have
been developed for PKA (FLARE-AKAR), PKC (FLARE-CKAR), and Akt (FLARE-AktAR)
and successfully used for multiplexed imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref621">621</xref></sup> Although this design is generalizable, fluorescence polarization
microscopy is needed to image FLARE sensors, limiting their broader
application. Considering the uniquely superior performance of single-FP-based
KARs, future efforts aimed at identifying and engineering new cpRFPs
should help accelerate the development of red-shifted single-FP KARs
to enhance both multiplexed and <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of
signaling pathways.</p><p>There are also PKA biosensor designs based
on the special properties
of certain FPs. For example, the ability of the green-emitting FP
Dronpa to induce proximity-dependent fluorescence intensity fluctuations
in the red-emitting FP TagRFP-T has enabled the development of fluorescence
fluctuation induced by contact (FLINC)-based biosensors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref></sup> As noted earlier in the text (see <xref rid="sec2.1.3" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec2.1.3" ref-type="other">2.1.3</xref></xref>), fluctuations
in FP intensity are critical for super-resolution imaging techniques
such as pcSOFI.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref630">630</xref></sup> Thus, by constructing
FLINC-AKAR1, Mo et al. were able to directly examine plasma membrane
PKA activity microdomains in super-resolution. Specifically, FLINC-AKAR1
imaging via pcSOFI revealed that PKA activity is strictly confined
to nanometer-scale domains (&#x0223c;350 nm diameter) that substantially
overlapped with clusters formed by AKAPs. Direct AKAP-PKA interactions
were also found to be required to form the observed PKA activity nanodomains.
In migrating Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, highly active PKA
nanodomains were only found along the leading edge while absent in
the trailing end, with filipodia exhibiting significantly higher PKA
activity in nanodomains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref></sup> Future development
of AKARs utilizing recently discovered or engineered FPs might produce
more interesting designs and be used in various conditions to address
lingering biological questions, as recently demonstrated through the
engineering of Dronpa-removed (Dr) FLINC AKAR, which introduces a
mutation that abolishes Dronpa fluorescence to enableed dual-color
super-resolution imaging to correlate PKA activity nanodomains with
subcellular structures.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref631">631</xref></sup></p><p>Alongside
the use of KARs to visualize kinase activity dynamics,
biosensors that directly report on the activation of specific kinases
can also provide crucial insights into signaling regulation. Kinase
activation biosensors have shined brightly in elucidating the regulation
of isoform-specific PKC signaling. Mammalian PKC comprises 10 major
isozymes, which fall into three main classes that are differentially
regulated by upstream signals. Dysregulation of PKC signaling is involved
in many pathophysiological conditions such as cancer and neurodegeneration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref632">632</xref></sup> and dissecting the contributions of individual
PKC isoforms is essential to understanding how cells precisely balance
PKC signaling to achieve homeostasis. Despite their distinct modes
of regulation, however, all PKC isoforms share highly conserved catalytic
domains and can phosphorylate many of the same substrate sequences
and are indistinguishable by kinase activity reporters. Although an
isozyme-specific CKAR was previously developed using an atypical PKC-specific
phosphorylation sequence derived from insulin-regulated membrane aminopeptidase
(IRAP),<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref633">633</xref></sup> this approach is difficult to
generalize, and PKC isozymes remain largely indistinguishable to KARs.
In this scenario, kinase activation biosensors, which often contain
the full-length kinase, are more advantageous because isoform specificity
is intrinsic to the biosensor design. For example, Colgan et al. leveraged
the fine-tuned, multistep conformational dynamics associated with
PKC activation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref634">634</xref></sup> to develop a pair of
biosensors to probe isoform-specific PKC signaling in synaptic plasticity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref635">635</xref></sup> While the role of PKC isozymes in synaptic
plasticity has long been recognized, whether PKC is activated in dendritic
spines and which PKC isozyme encodes synaptic plasticity was unknown.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref636">636</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref637">637</xref></sup> Colgan and colleagues therefore constructed the FLIM-FRET sensors
ITRACK and IDOCKS to study this question. Both sensors use a bimolecular
design where one component fuses a specific PKC isozyme to EGFP as
the FRET donor and the second component contains mCherry as the FRET
acceptor, either directly targeted to the plasma membrane (ITRACK)
or fused to a PKC pseudosubstrate domain (IDOCKS). Once the EGFP-tagged
PKC is activated, it translocates to the plasma membrane (ITRACKS)
or binds to the pseudosubstrate domain (IDOCKS), inducing a change
in the donor fluorescence lifetime. This approach revealed that only
PKC&#x003b1; was required for synaptic plasticity in dendritic spines
of hippocampal neurons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref635">635</xref></sup></p><p>In another
example, the Akt activation sensor ReAktion1, which
was constructed by sandwiching full-length Akt isoform 1 (Akt1) between
CFP and YFP, revealed that interdomain interactions between the PH
and catalytic domains play a central role during the Akt1 activation
cycle by controlling disassociation of active Akt1 from the plasma
membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref638">638</xref></sup> A recent study suggested that
Akt isoforms exhibit spatiotemporally distinct activation patterns,
with endosomal PI(3,4)P<sub>2</sub> selectively activating Akt2, whereas
PIP<sub>3</sub> selectively turns on Akt1 and Akt3 at the plasma membrane.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref639">639</xref></sup> Thus, Akt2- and Akt3-specific ReAktion vartiants
will likely prove useful in detailing these distinct activation mechanisms.
Indeed, we anticipate that broader development of kinase activation
sensors will yield similar insights for other kinases, providing a
crucial window into isoform-selective kinase regulation.</p></sec><sec id="sec10.2"><label>10.2</label><title>CMGC- and STE-Family Kinases</title><p>The

monitor the spatiotemporal regulation of different signaling activation
and distinguish downstream signaling bias between the branches have
unique advantages. Due to the important role of ERK, many efforts
have been focused on developing ERK activity reporters. Just like
the kinases of the AGC family, various design strategies have been
employed in developing ERK biosensors with high performance.</p><p>Current popular ERK activity sensor designs are mostly based on the
original FRET-based ERK activity reporter (EKAR), which is composed
of YFP and CFP flanking a molecular switch containing a WW domain,
a Gly linker, and an ERK-specific substrate sequence which contains
an ERK docking motif. The docking motif is important for all MAPKs,
including ERK, to specifically recognize and phosphorylate their substrates.
EKAR exhibits an increased yellow/cyan emission ratio upon ERK activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref643">643</xref></sup> To improve EKAR, Komatsu et al. modified the
original sensor by incorporating a long, flexible EV linker, as discussed
in <xref rid="sec3.3.2" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec3.3.2" ref-type="other">3.3.2</xref></xref>, along with a nonmonomeric FP pair to ensure that the FRET response
was completely distance dependent, which greatly improved the dynamic
range of the resulting EKAR-EV sensor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref211">211</xref></sup> This general EV linker was also used in many other kinase reporters
to improve their dynamic range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref211">211</xref></sup> Meanwhile,
optimization of the FRET pair or the arrangement of the sensor components
has yielded a series of improved EKARs (EKAR2G, EKAR-TVV, EKAR3, EKAR4).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref644">644</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref647">647</xref></sup> A later study found that the Cdc25-derived substrate sequence in
EKAR can be phosphorylated by Cdk1, generating a nonspecific signal.
But introducing two mutations into the substrate peptide resolved
the issue (EKAREN4, EKAREN5).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref648">648</xref></sup></p><p>Alongside FRET-based EKAR, the ERK kinase translocation reporter
(ERK KTR) is another widely used sensor design that has yielded important
insights into ERK/MAPK signaling. KTR technology was originally developed
for another MAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), following a comprehensive
search for a phosphorylation-dependent nuclear NES derived from c-Jun,
which is positively regulated by JNK. This was combined with a negatively
phospho-regulated NLS and fused to the green-emitting FP mClover to
generate JNK KTR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref190">190</xref></sup> Although the nuclear
translocation of FP-tagged full-length ERK has previously been used
to monitor ERK activation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref649">649</xref></sup> the overexpression
of functional ERK may lead to undesired signaling perturbations. Thus,
an ERK sensor following the KTR design was generated by fusing an
ERK substrate sequence from Elk1 to an NLS and NES alongside an FP.
As with other KTRs, phosphorylation alters the substrate charge, which
inhibits the NLS and promotes nuclear export of the KTR, redistributing
the fluorescence signal into the cytosol.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref190">190</xref></sup> A similar KTR for p38 MAPK was constructed utilizing an endogenous
p38 substrate, MEF2C, enabling specific detection of p38 activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref190">190</xref></sup> Importantly, KTRs are single-color sensors,
which can be easily coimaged with other KTRs to achieve multiplexed
visualization of MAPK signaling. Such simultaneous analysis of different
branches of the same upstream signaling pathway could provide valuable
information on signaling crosstalk, which plays an important role
in feedback regulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref650">650</xref></sup> The generalizable
KTR design has been used to develop biosensors for other kinase families
besides MAPKs, including CDKs and AGC kinases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref651">651</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref652">652</xref></sup> For example, a translocation-based activity reporter for cyclin-dependent
kinase 2 (CDK2) revealed that cells immediately build up CDK2 activity
before entering the next cell cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref653">653</xref></sup> The CDK2 reporter has been used along with another translocation
based CDK4/6 reporter to simultaneously monitor CDK2 and CDK4/6 activities
in human mammary epithelial cells, revealing that rapid elevation
of CDK4/6 precedes a gradual increase in CDK2 activity, and temporary
CDK4/6 inactivation was found to regulate the length of G1 phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref654">654</xref></sup> For additional discussion of cell cycle-related
biosensors, please see <xref rid="sec13.1" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec13.1" ref-type="other">13.1</xref></xref>.</p><p>Many other generalizable designs have also
been used to develop
effective ERK activity reporters, including ddFP-based FPX<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref></sup> and a bimolecular FRET sensor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref655">655</xref></sup> Some newer ERK activity reporter designs include the Fra-1-based
integrative reporter of ERK (FIRE), which is a degradation-dependent
ERK activity reporter. FIRE is constructed by fusing mVenus to the
PEST domain of the ERK target Fra-1. Phosphorylation of the Fra-1
PEST domain stabilizes the fusion protein, leading to sustained expression,
otherwise, the fusion protein undergoes rapid degradation. ERK activity
thus affects sensor fate, whether or not it escapes from degradation,
in cells, and the fluorescence intensity of FIRE can be used to monitor
ERK dynamics.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref656">656</xref></sup> Recently, liquid&#x02013;liquid
phase separation (LLPS) of signaling proteins has drawn lots of attention.
The dramatic and reversible formation of intracellular &#x0201c;droplets&#x0201d;
through this biophysical process has also inspired a novel reporting
strategy for monitoring kinase activity. Zhang and colleagues developed
the separation of phases-based activity reporter of kinase (SPARK)
design by incorporating two coiled coil homo-oligomeric tags (HOTags),
HO-tag3 and HO-tag6, fused to a kinase substrate and FP reporter and
a PAABD, respectively. Using an ERK substrate and WW domain, they
generated SPARK-ERK, wherein ERK activation induces binding between
the phosphorylated ERK substrate and WW domain, thereby promoting
multivalent interactions between HO-tag domains to form liquid-like
fluorescent droplets. By measuring droplet fluorescence intensity
with respect to total cellular fluorescence, Zhang et al. used SPARK-ERK
to achieve sensitive imaging of ERK activity in live <italic>Drosophila</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref657">657</xref></sup> Although these new types of ERK biosensors
may not be used explicitly to measure subcellular ERK activity, these
designs only contain one fluorescent protein, potentially allowing
for multiplexed imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref657">657</xref></sup></p><p>In parallel
to ERK activation by MAPKK, JNK and p38 are different
MAPKs that act downstream of RTKs. p38 regulates the expression of
many cytokines and plays a crucial role in immune responses, and p38
signaling is thus an important target of anti-inflammatory drugs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref658">658</xref></sup> Regulation of the JNK signaling pathway is
extremely complex. Multiple upstream regulators are known to activate
JNK;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref659">659</xref></sup> thus, constructing a JNK biosensor
can help elucidate the complicated spatiotemporal regulation of this
pathway. Many principles that apply to the development of ERK biosensors
are also instructive in developing JNK and p38 MAPK reporters, including
the requirement for a docking motif near the substrate sequence for
JNK and p38 to specifically recognize and phosphorylate their corresponding
activity reporter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref660">660</xref></sup> For example, Fosbrink
et al. tested several different JNK docking motifs to construct a
JNK activity reporter (JNKAR), including a JNK binding sequence corresponding
to amino acids 33&#x02013;43 of the N-terminal transactivation domain
of c-Jun, a unique binding motif immediately C-terminal to the phosphoacceptor
site Thr148 in Jun dimerization protein 2 (JDP2), and a well-characterized
docking domain from JIP1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref661">661</xref></sup> The resulting
sensing unit consisting of substrate domain, docking domain and PAABD
forms a FRET reporter in conjunction with a CFP/YFP pair. The substrate/docking
sequence from JDP2, incorporating an Asp substitution at +3 relative
to the phosphoacceptor Thr of JDP2, showed the largest change after
JNK activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref661">661</xref></sup> A NIR-FRET pair was
also used to generate a JNKAR for multiplexed imaging.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref624">624</xref></sup> The FRET-based p38 reporter PerKy-38 contains
a synthetic substrate peptide that combines a p38 docking motif derived
from the MEF2A protein, an endogenous p38 substrate, with a p38 substrate
sequence spanning residues 54&#x02013;73 of c-Jun, both of which ensure
the specific response to p38 activity. Real-time monitoring of p38
activity using this FRET reporter revealed an oscillatory pattern
of p38 activity, which is necessary for efficient expression of pro-inflammatory
genes, such as IL-6, IL8 and COX-2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref662">662</xref></sup></p><p>A notable gap in the biosensor toolbox for MAPK/ERK activity is
the lack of single-FP based activity reporters, which will be valuable

CAMK-family kinases regulate myriad cellular processes, including
dendritic spine morphology, hematopoietic stem cell maintenance, cell
proliferation, and apoptosis, among others.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref663">663</xref></sup> Unlike the extraordinary efforts spent in developing Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators, however, sensor development for this downstream kinase
family has been relatively limited.</p><p>CaMKII belongs to the CAMK2
subfamily and was one of the first Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-regulated kinases
to be discovered. CaMKII has four highly homologous isoforms and plays
a critical role in brain development and neuronal activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref665">665</xref></sup> In the basal state, CaMKII is kept inactive
by an autoinhibitory domain that masks the catalytic site. Binding
of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM to the CaM-binding domain induces a conformational
change that relieves autoinhibition, activating CaMKII.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref666">666</xref></sup> CaMKII activation sensors based on this conformational
change have been widely used to elucidate the role of CaMKII in many
biological systems. The first of these, Camui&#x003b1;, was constructed
by sandwiching the full-length CaMKII&#x003b1; isoform between YFP and
CFP. Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM induced conformational changes in Camui&#x003b1;
alter the proximity and orientation of YFP and CFP, thus coupling
CaMKII activation to changes in FRET. Camui&#x003b1; was used to detect
autophosphorylation-dependent CaMKII activation in living neurons
at single-dendrite and spine resolution.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref667">667</xref></sup> The impact of Camui&#x003b1; has been felt far beyond neuroscience.
This design has also been adapted to study other CaMKII isoforms in
additional systems such as cardiomyocytes.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref668">668</xref></sup></p><p>One relatively straightforward way to improve FRET sensor
performance
is to incorporate a better-performing FRET pair. For example, Clover
and mRuby2 were introduced to Camui&#x003b1; to generate Camui-CR, which
showed increased dynamic range and SNR. Furthermore, because Camui-CR
incorporates a red-shifted FRET pair, it also exhibited reduced photobleaching
and phototoxicity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref669">669</xref></sup> Typically, optimizing
the distance between the donor and acceptor FPs is achieved by incorporating
extended linkers between sensing unit components (see previous sections),
a perspective informed by the protein secondary structure. Alternatively,
by examining the three-dimensional structure of the CaMKII holoenzyme,
Fujii and colleagues were able to reposition the FRET pair so that
both FPs are closely positioned and exposed at the surface in the
multimeric holoenzyme structure, yielding an overall improvement in
performance compared with Camui&#x003b1;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref670">670</xref></sup> The authors generated multiple versions of their CaMKII activation
sensor, K2&#x003b1;, with different FRET pairs, including CFP/YFP, mCherry/Sapphire
and mCherry/YFP, which they coimaged with a spectrally compatible
calcineurin activation sensor. Simultaneous imaging of CaMKII and
calcineurin activation in response to glutamate input revealed that
CaMKII&#x003b1; activation was mostly restricted to the stimulated spine,
while calcineurin activity was mainly observed in the adjacent shaft,
suggesting that a single spine was able to transform the glutamatergic
input sequence into well resolved spatiotemporal signaling activation
patterns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref670">670</xref></sup></p><p>CaMKII activation sensors
have also been developed for FLIM readouts.
One advantage of the lifetime-based readout is that quantification
is independent of FP/sensor concentration. However, the CFP/YFP FRET
pairs that are widely used in many emission-ratiometric FRET sensors
are often not ideal for FLIM due to the complex lifetime decay kinetics
of many CFPs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref671">671</xref></sup> Furthermore, because FLIM
only requires measuring donor fluorescence, nonradiative acceptors
are often preferred for FLIM-FRET applications, as eliminating acceptor
fluorescence not only reduces bleedthrough contamination of the donor
channel but also effectively yields a single-color sensor that is
more compatible with other fluorescent tools. In line with this purpose,
a few FLIM-compatible CaMKII activation sensors have been generated
using newly engineered FPs. For example, Green-Camui was developed
using REACh (Resonance-Energy-Accepting Chromoprotein), a very low-emitting
derivative of YFP, as the FRET acceptor. The resulting sensor has
high sensitivity and brightness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref672">672</xref></sup> Another
dark acceptor, ShadowG, which has even lower emission than REACh,
was used to generate ShadowG-Camui, an improved FLIM-FRET sensor that
showed very low cell-to-cell variation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref673">673</xref></sup> A red-shifted FLIM-FRET sensor that pairs mRuby2 with a dark mCherry
mutant has also been developed for multiplexed imaging and is compatible
with blue-light optogenetic tools.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref674">674</xref></sup></p><p>An important caveat of using Camui and similar probes is that they
require overexpression of the active kinase. To reduce interference
and complement the information obtained with activation sensors, CaMKII
activity sensors have recently been developed. Ardestani et al. constructed
the first CaMKII activity reporter, FRESCA (FRET-based Sensor of CaMKII
Activity), by sandwiching a synthetic CaMKII substrate peptide (syntide)
and FHA2 domain between mTurquoise2 and mVenus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref675">675</xref></sup> Side-by-side comparison with Camui&#x003b1; demonstrated
that the Camui&#x003b1; response would abruptly terminate during prolonged
Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, whereas FRESCA continued to respond,
suggesting that FRESCA is more suitable for long-term imaging than
Camui&#x003b1;.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref675">675</xref></sup> Indeed, as an activation
biosensor, Camui-alpha reflects the conformational change of CaMKII
itself. CaMKII is suggested to remain in the &#x0201c;on&#x0201d; state
following stimulus-induced autophosphorylation of the kinase, even
if the stimulus is removed. On the other hand, a kinase activity reporter
for CaMKII is a proxy for CaMKII-mediated signaling, although it is
also influenced by cellular phosphatase activities. More recently,
Gaido and colleagues reported the development of a single-FP-based
CaMKII activity reporter (CaMKAR), which was constructed following
the aforementioned ExRai-KAR design (see <xref rid="sec10.1" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec10.1" ref-type="other">10.1</xref></xref>) by sandwiching cpGFP between a substrate
peptide containing a CaMKII&#x003b4; autophosphorylation sequence and
FHA1 domain. CaMKAR showed a 100% excitation-ratio increase in response
to Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation in HEK293T cells and was sensitive enough
to be used in a high-throughput drug repurposing screen and identified
several previously unrecognized CaMKII inhibitors with clinically
relevant potency.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref676">676</xref></sup></p><p>Another important
member of the CAMK family that is indirectly
regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> /CaM is the AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK), which functions as a master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis.
Composed of &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b3; subunits, AMPK can be activated
in response to various stimuli, such as starvation and oxidative stress.
Complete AMPK activation involves the phosphorylation of Thr172 within
the &#x003b1; subunit activation loop, which is mediated by the tumor-suppressor
kinase LKB1 as well as by CaMKK2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref677">677</xref></sup> The
first AMPK activity reporter (AMPKAR) was constructed by Tsou and
colleagues, who identified an AMPK-specific phosphorylation sequence
using a positional screening peptide library, which they then substituted
into the AKAR3 sensor backbone.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref678">678</xref></sup> Using
AMPKAR, Tsou and colleagues were able to observe stimulus-specific
spatial differences in AMPK activity: energy stress was found to induce
cytosolic AMPK activity, whereas Ca<sup>2+</sup> induced AMPK activity
in both the cytosol and nucleus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref678">678</xref></sup> However,
plasma membrane AMPK activity was difficult to detect, even using
an improved sensor (ABKAR) with twice the dynamic range of AMPKAR.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref679">679</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref680">680</xref></sup> This was instead achieved using a different design that separates
ABKAR into a bimolecular sensor, bimAMPKAR. Switching to a bimolecular
design greatly increased the dynamic range of the plasma membrane-targeted
sensor, which allowed Depry and colleagues to investigate the bidirectional
regulation of plasma membrane AMPK activity by PKA signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref655">655</xref></sup> More recently, Schmitt et al. were able to
extend the emerging single-FP-based ExRai-KAR design to AMPK and achieve
even further improvements in dynamic range and sensitivity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref681">681</xref></sup> Using ExRai-AMPKAR, which showed a rougly 2-fold
maximum excitation ratio change in response to AMPK activation, the
authors were able to dissect spatial AMPK signaling in greater detail,
illuminating the dynamics and regulation of AMPK activity at mitochondria,
the lysosome, and in the nucleus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref681">681</xref></sup></p><p>Cellular energy stress triggers AMPK activation through the binding
of AMP or ADP to the AMKP&#x003b3; subunit, which induces conformational

or &#x003b2; (AMPfret2.0). Structure-guided engineering was also performed
to maximize adenylate-induced FRET change while preserving the wild-type
binding affinity. AMPfret successfully reported conformational changes
induced by AMP/ADP binding. Notably, AMPfret respones were unaffected
by the Thr172 phosphorylation state, suggesting that adenylate-induced
conformational switching is independent of activation loop phosphorylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref682">682</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec10.4"><label>10.4</label><title>TK- and TKL-Family Kinases</title><p>Unlike

in a variety of cellular progress, such as proliferation, migration,
and survival. Autophosphorylation of PDGFR at Tyr751 recruits SH2-containing
effector proteins, which was utilized to build a PDGFR reporter. A
PAABD for binding to phosphorylated Tyr751 was selected from various
SH2 domains from different effector proteins. This work revealed that
the source of the SH2 domain is crucial to the selectivity of the
PDGFR biosensor, as SH2 domains from Nck-2 and Shp-2 but not Src specifically
bound the activated PDGFR reporter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref688">688</xref></sup></p><p>The Src subfamily of TKs, including Src, focal adhesion kinase
(FAK), and Fyn, among others, play key roles in signal transduction
by a variety of cell surface receptors in response to diverse stimuli.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref689">689</xref></sup> Src kinase is involved in many intricate strategies
to regulate signaling that controls fundamental cellular processes,
including cell growth, differentiation, migration, and cell survival.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref690">690</xref></sup> The first Src activity reporter was developed
by Ting and colleagues in 2001, featuring a design similar to that
of other TK reporters and using a substrate sequence derived from
an <italic>in vitro</italic> library screen. However, validation experiments
revealed that the reporter was also phosphorylated by Abl, Lck, and
EGFR, casting doubt on the specificity of this reporter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref685">685</xref></sup> Wang et al. later replaced the substrate with
a sequence derived from the endogenous c-Src substrate p130cas, which
resolved this issue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref687">687</xref></sup> Color variants
of this Src reporter, featuring different donor and acceptor FPs,
have since been generated to improve its dynamic range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref184">184</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref691">691</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref692">692</xref></sup> In addition to exchanging the
FRET pair, introducing a single mutation within the phosphotyrosine-binding
pocket in the SH2 domain, which was predicted to affect the binding
affinity and reduce basal FRET, was also found to significantly increased
the dynamic range of the sensor.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref693">693</xref></sup> Using
this method, Ouyang et al. were able to construct and optimize a biosensor
for Fyn, another Src-family TK, which they further targeted to plasma
membrane microdomains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref694">694</xref></sup> The authors observed
different growth factor-induced FRET responses from sensors tagged
with targeting motifs from either Lyn kinase or Fyn kinase itself,
suggesting the presence of functionally distinct subtypes of plasma
membrane rafts. Relatively high levels of Fyn activity were also detected
in the perinuclear region, further highlighting the importance of
the native subcellular environment in regulating biochemical activities.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref694">694</xref></sup> Unlike Src sensors that typically require different
targeting motifs to report localized signaling due to fast diffusion
of the untargeted sensor molecules, FAK-SPARK biosensors can detect
subcellular FAK activity without being targeted to subcellular locations,
as FAK-SPARK droplets only form in places where active FAK is present,
achieving visualization of FAK activity within single focal adhesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref695">695</xref></sup></p><p>ZAP70 (zeta-chain-associated protein
kinase 70) activation is an
essential step in T-cell receptor (TCR) mediated signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref696">696</xref></sup> ZAP70 is recruited to TCR upon receptor engagement
and is responsible for phosphorylating the adaptor protein LAT (linker
for activation of T cells) that further recruits a critical signalosome.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref697">697</xref></sup> Randriamampita et al. therefore developed Reporter
of ZAP70 Activity (ROZA) to examine the spatiotemporal activity of
ZAP70 at the immune synapse.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref698">698</xref></sup> The authors
tested substrate peptides corresponding to three ZAP70-specific phosphorylation
sites within LAT, which they paired with the corresponding SH2-containing
binding partner. Ultimately, they constructed ROZA using the Grb2
SH2 and a substrate peptide spanning Tyr175 from LAT as the molecular
switch.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref698">698</xref></sup> Improved Fyn and ZAP70 sensors
were also recently developed using a systematic optimization approach.
Specifically, Liu and colleagues developed a method called FRET-seq
to rapidly identify improved sensors directly in mammalian cells using
high-throughput sequencing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref220">220</xref></sup> Libraries
of &#x0201c;self-activating&#x0201d; (sa)FRET biosensors are screened
according to their FRET signal via FACS using kinase biosensor variants
tethered to an active kinase or a negative control, and biosensor
sequences recovered by high-throughput sequencing. Liu et al. applied
FRET-seq to screen for optimized substrate sequences and obtain Fyn
and ZAP70 biosensors with improved dynamic ranges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref220">220</xref></sup> Although so far only applied to TK sensors, FRET-seq shows
tremendous promise for improving the performance of other kinase activity
reporters.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref220">220</xref></sup></p><p>Activation sensors
for TKs have also been developed but are less
common than Ser/Thr kinase activation sensors. Cai et al. developed
an FAK activation sensor by taking advantage of the autophosphorylation-dependent
change in the intramolecular interaction between the FERM domain and
the catalytic domain of FAK, which is a major mechanism of FAK activation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref699">699</xref></sup> The positions of CFP and YFP in the sensor
were determined based on structural studies: CFP was fused to the
N-terminus of FAK, in front of the FERM domain, and YFP was inserted
at residue 413 in the linker between the FERM and catalytic domains,
yielding CYFAK413. FAK activation induces dissociation of the FERM
and catalytic domains, changing the conformational positioning between
the FRET pair, and thus the emission ratio. Using CYFAK413, the authors
found that PIP<sub>2</sub>-containing vesicles induced a conformational
change and activated FAK <italic>in vitro</italic>, with PIP<sub>2</sub> binding a basic patch within the FERM domain, and that perturbing
PIP<sub>2</sub> levels altered FAK activation in living cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref699">699</xref></sup></p><p>Despite the broad biological functions
performed by TKs, sensor
development for this important kinase family has lagged. Many strategies
that have been applied to study other kinases, such as AGC-family
kinases, have yet to be tested to construct reporters for TKs. Considering
the importance of TKs, we hope to see more efforts devoted to increasing
the diversity as well as the performance of TK reporters, enabling
their broader application in biological investigations.</p></sec><sec id="sec10.5"><label>10.5</label><title>Atypical Kinases</title><p>Atypical kinases

Nevertheless, sensors that directly report on phosphatases can provide
valuable information to help us better understand the dynamics of
protein phosphorylation in living cells.</p><p>So far, protein phosphatase
activity biosensors have only been developed for calcineurin (CaN),
a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-dependent serine/threonine phosphatase that
regulates diverse cellular functions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref713">713</xref></sup> The CaN activity reporter 1 (CaNAR1) and its improved version, CaNAR2,
use the N-terminal regulatory domain from the well-studied CaN substrate
nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) as the sensing unit, which

been regarded as more difficult to study than kinases due to the wide
variety of different catalytic mechanisms they use and the challenge
of matching specific substrates to specific phosphatases,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref716">716</xref></sup> which complicates the development of phosphatase

recent work is shedding new light on phosphatase substrate preferences.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref719">719</xref></sup> Dephosphorylation is also subtractive, meaning
that a biosensor designed to function as a surrogate phosphatase substrate
must get basally phosphorylated in cells to properly report phosphatase
activity. Given these challenges, development of phosphatase activity
reporters has progressed slowly. However, phosphatase activation sensors
can be generated as a more straightforward alternative because they
directly use the phosphatase itself as the sensing domain. For example,

FRET-based GTPase sensor for live-cell imaging was designed for visualizing
Rac GTPase. Despite requiring a fluorescent dye for FRET imaging,
this sensor provided the first glimpse of the highly dynamic nature
of small GTPase signaling.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref740">740</xref></sup> The development
of FPs eventually obviated the need for dye labeling in FRET biosensor

similar to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator Cameleon, the sensing unit
of Raichu-Ras consists of HRas and the Raf1 RBD, which are sandwiched
by the CFP-YFP FRET pair. Activation of HRas by GTP binding promotes
the interaction between HRas and the RBD, inducing a conformational
change that alters the emission ratio readout of the FRET pair. Raichu-Ras
exhibited high specificity to Ras over other Ras family proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref741">741</xref></sup> By replacing Ras with Rap1, a Raichu-Rap1 sensor
was also developed alongside Raichu-Ras, and both Raichu sensors were
used to monitor Ras and Rap1 activation in epidermal growth factor
(EGF) stimulated COS-7 cells. Spatiotemporal activation images of
EGF-stimulated Ras and Rap1 revealed that Ras was activated at the
peripheral plasma membrane while Rap1 was activated at perinuclear

The domain structure also differs for each FLARE sensor, again emphasizing
the complex conformational change in FRET sensors, which might need
trial-and-error optimization. One interesting study aimed to optimize
Raichu-Cdc42 by including two p21-binding domains (PBDs) in the sensor:
one that interacts with intramolecular Cdc42 to drive the FRET change
and a second GTPase-binding-deficient mutant that serves as an autoinhibitory

displays a simpler lifetime decay curve than many other CFPs and could
therefore be measured via either emission-ratio imaging or FLIM-FRET,
providing flexibility in choosing the experimental setup.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref749">749</xref></sup></p><p>Another FRET-based Ras sensor that is
also compatible with fluorescence
lifetime measurements is the FRas reporter, which utilizes a FRET-based

dual-color 2p-FLIM along with an EGFP-based CaMKII reporter, Green-Camui.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref752">752</xref></sup> A recent study by Shcherbakova and colleagues

EGF-induced
ERK/MAPK activity,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref741">741</xref></sup> by design, the sensor
contains full-length wild-type Ras, so expression of the Raichu-Ras
biosensor resembles Ras overexpression. In addition, Raichu and similar
designs (Dora, FRas) rely on Ras GAP/GEF activity to exchange nucleotides
bound to Ras, meaning that these sensors in fact reflect the dynamics
of endogenous RasGAPs/GEFs rather than true Ras activity. To overcome
this limitation, instead of using full-length Ras in the design, Weeks
et al. recently developed a Ras activity reporter (RasAR) that employs
a pseudoligand derived from the effector binding region of Ras, which
exhibits low-affinity binding to the Raf1 RBD (<xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref></xref>b).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref753">753</xref></sup> In the
absence of Ras, the pseudoligand engages the RBD, bringing a tethered
FRET pair into proximity, while in the presence of active Ras, the
pseudoligand is displaced by preferential binding of active Ras to
the RBD, leading to a decrease in FRET efficiency. RasAR was shown
to successfully detect cellular Ras activity and captured the dynamics
of oncogenic KRasG12C in live cells treated with an FDA-approved Ras

the cellular glycome, the study of which has been difficult to conduct
in the live-cell context. Traditional methods to identify changes
in glycosylation rely on combined biochemical assays and genetic sequencing
approaches. The subcellular regulation of glycosylation is a prime
area to be discovered with the use of time- and spatially resolved
biosensors. However, only a small number of biosensors have been developed
for this purpose. Early on, Carrillo, Krishnamoorthy, and Mahal developed
a FRET-based sensor to specifically detect &#x003b2;-<italic>O</italic>-<italic>N</italic>-acetyl-<sc>d</sc>-glucosamine (&#x003b2;-<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc), a modification that occurs on Ser or Thr residues
and is involved in complex crosstalk with phosphorylation. <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation is mostly found on nuclear and cytoplasmic
proteins, in contrast with the secretory pathway distribution of targets
of other types of glycosylation. Furthermore, because the donor for <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation is generated in a manner dependent on metabolic
pathways, <italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation status can be indicative
of metabolic state. The sensor developed by Carrillo and colleagues
features eCFP fused to the N-terminus of the &#x003b2;-<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAc-binding protein, GalD, followed by a modified substrate sequence
from casein kinase and Venus at the C-terminus. &#x003b2;-<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation of the substrate sequence induces GalD binding, resulting
in a conformational change that increases the yellow/cyan emission
ratio.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref761">761</xref></sup> This design could be generalized
by incorporating substrate sequences derived fom other targets of
interest, potentially enabling broader detection of &#x003b2;-<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation across various proteins in live cells. Another
sensor for detecting <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site occupancy
on POIs was reported in 2012 by Losfeld and colleagues in the Freeze
lab.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref762">762</xref></sup> The biosensor builds on a previous

on the inhibition of <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation by tunicamycin
through modifications to the luciferase itself.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref763">763</xref></sup> This strategy was adapted to generate an FP-based biosensor
wherein a modified GFP containing <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation
sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) was targeted to the ER such that glycosylation
of these sites will destroy GFP fluorescence. This biosensor was used
to obtain end point measurements of steady-state glycosylation levels
but did not provide information on temporal dynamics.</p><p>A more
recent biosensor developed by Li et al. in 2021 was used
to detect uridine diphosphate <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine
(UDP-GlcNAc).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref764">764</xref></sup> UDP-GlcNAc is crucial
for <italic>O</italic>-linked <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminylation
(<italic>O</italic>-GlcNAcylation). UDP-GlcNAc concentrations regulate <italic>O</italic>-GlycNAcylation and so can be useful for gaining insights
into glycosylation involved in cellular signaling and metabolism.
The sensor, called UGAcS, incorporates cpGFP into an inactive form
of the <italic>E. coli</italic> UDP-GlcNAc transferase murG, yielding
a ratiometric response.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref764">764</xref></sup> However, UGAcS
was also shown to bind and detect UDP and UTP, potentially resulting
in nonspecific signals. A variant of the sensor that does not detect
UDP-GlcNAc and only detects UDP or UTP should therefore be used as
a negative control. A follow-up study introduced a red UDP-GlcNAc
sensor called bapaUGAc (boronic acid- and peptide-assisted UDP-GlcNAc).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref765">765</xref></sup> This sensor incorporates a genetically encodable

UDP-GlcNAc. Boronolectin is tagged to Lysine 30 of ecpmApple, an engineered
variant of cpmApple that exhibits enhanced folding efficiency, to
achieve a turn-off response to UDP-GlcNAc. BapaUGAc exhibited greater
sensitivity for UDP-GlcNAc over UDP and UTP compared to UGAcS but
exhibited slight sensitivity to a similar molecule, UDP-GalNAc. The
sensor was used in the ER and Golgi to probe subcellular changes in
UDP-GlcNAc in response to metabolic and pharmacological disruptions.
BapaUGAc was also multiplexed with the green UGAcS sensor to probe
changes in UDP-GlcNAc levels in the ER and cytosol simultaneously.</p><p>These few biosensors have already made possible the characterization
of subcellular changes in glycosylation. However, the toolbox for

a PTM that signals proteins for degradation and can thereby have great
impact on cellular signaling and function. However, there are limited
approaches to detecting ubiquitylation in the live-cell context using
fluorescent biosensors. Ganesan and colleagues first developed a bimolecular
FRET-based approach for detecting protein ubiquitylation in 2006 using
REACh (see <xref rid="sec10.3" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec10.3" ref-type="other">10.3</xref></xref>) as a FRET acceptor to EGFP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref766">766</xref></sup> In their approach, REACh is labeled with ubiquitin, and GFP is fused
to a ubiquitination substrate. As a proof of concept, Ganesan et al.
used a Pro-, Glu-, Ser-, and Thr-rich (PEST) sequence as an efficient
ubiquitylation substrate.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref766">766</xref></sup> Proximity
between REACh and EGFP leads to a decrease in the EGFP fluorescence
lifetime (as well as quenching of EGFP emission, but this requires
a reference FP for proper quantification) and indicates interaction
between ubiquitin and a ubiquitylation substrate, and thus ubiquitylation.
Although it has not been utilized for detecting ubiquitylation of
other substrates, this approach may be generalizable to other POIs.</p><p>A recent paper from the Cappell lab demonstrates another generalizable
design for detecting ubiquitylation of POIs by specific E3 ubiquitin
ligase complexes. Briefly, a sensor for detecting the activity of
&#x003b2;-TrCP, which recruits substrates to the SCF E3 ligase complex,
was constructed by fusing a noncanonical degron motif specifically
recognized by &#x003b2;-TrCP to YFP. Upon ubiquitylation of the biosensor,
YFP fluorescence decreases as the reporter is degraded.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref767">767</xref></sup> Such an approach should be adaptable to monitor
other E3 ligase complexes by replacing the degron motif. Despite this
potentially generalizable approach and the significant biological
questions to be studied, there have yet to be many forays into the
field of ubiquitylation biosensing. For instance, multiplexed imaging
of ubiquitylation biosensors with smart-labels of translation for
POIs can provide a more thorough picture of protein regulation and
lifetime in the live-cell context. Thus, future developments in this
area should ultimately contribute to a better understanding of protein
degradation.</p></sec><sec id="sec12.3"><label>12.3</label><title>Histone Modifications</title><p>Eukaryotic
DNA is intricately organized and packaged within chromatin structures
that are unwound when genes need to be accessed, whether for DNA replication
or transcription. The nucleosome is a core component of this chromatin
structure, consisting of DNA coiled around histone proteins (H2A,
H2B, H3, and H4) that form an octomer. Access to packed DNA is partially
regulated by specific PTMs, namely methylation, acetylation, and phosphorylation,
of histone tails to alter chromatin structure. Thus, histone modification
sites are crucial players in our understanding of the regulation of
chromatin structure and gene expression.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref768">768</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref770">770</xref></sup></p><p>Histone methylation occurs on Lys and Arg residues of histone
proteins and serves to silence genes, whereas demethylation can promote
activation of gene transcription.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref771">771</xref></sup> One
well studied site of histone methylation is histone H3 Lys 9 trimethylation
(H3K9me3), which is considered a hallmark of heterochromatin and regulated
during the cell cycle, although the dynamics of this regulation are
not well-defined. The Ting lab first introduced FRET-based reporters
of histone H3 Lys 9 or Lys 27 methylation incorporating a histone
H3-derived substrate peptide that includes the methlylation site tethered
to a chromodomain that senses the desired methylated residues sandwiched
between the FRET pair CFP and YFP.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref772">772</xref></sup> The
chromodomain of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) was utilized to sense
H3K9 methylation, whereas the polycomb chromodomain was utilized to
detect H3K27 methylation. Rather than reporting directly on methylation
of endogenous histone H3, methylation of the histone peptide within
the biosensor instead serves as a proxy to indicate native regulation
of histone methylation by endogenous methylases and demethylases.</p><p>To elucidate the dynamic regulation of histone H3 methylation during
mitosis, the Wang lab generated a FRET-based biosensor of H3K9 trimethylation.
The H3K9me3 reporter consists of a full-length histone H3, rather
than a peptide, linked to the HP1 chromodomain, which are flanked
by ECFP and YPet. In addition, a flexible EV linker is included between
ECFP and HP1. Upon recognition of H3K9me3, HP1 binds H3, leading to
a conformational change that increases the yellow/cyan emission ratio.
Imaging the H3K9me3 biosensor, which was overexpressed in mammalian
cells, revealed dynamic regulation of this PTM during mitosis, with
a marked decrease in methylation during the G2 phase of the cell cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref773">773</xref></sup></p><p>A class of sensors that aim to detect
endogenous changes in histone
methylation directly were generated by Lungu and colleagues from the
Jeltsch lab, named Bimolecular Anchor Detectors (BiADs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref774">774</xref></sup> Available BiAD sensors can detect locus-specific
H3K9me3 or DNA cytosine-C5 methylation (5mC), an epigenetic DNA modification
that also regulates chromatin accessibility. The BiAD sensors consist
of one component composed of a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein
fused to the N-terminus of split Venus, and a second component containing
the detection domain fused to the C-terminus of split Venus. As in
the previously developed sensor, the HP1 chromodomain was used to
detect H3K9me3, and the methyl-binding domain of human methyl-CpG
binding protein (MBD1) was used to detect 5mC at mouse major satellite
repeats or human pan-centromeric sequences. Because the sensor utilizes
a complementation-based approach, time-resolved data are difficult
to obtain. Currently, there are only a few available biosensors for
detecting histone methylation, focusing on H3K9 methylation, but as
interest in the dynamic regulation of such modifications increases,
new biosensors may be generated to investigate methylation at other
sites.</p><p>Another PTM commonly found on histones is acetylation,
which occurs
on Lys residues and neutralizes their positive charge. This is thought
to reduce the strength of interactions between DNA and histones and
thereby increase accessibility of DNA to transcriptional regulators
or factors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref775">775</xref></sup> Although histone acetylation
is highly dynamic and significant to gene expression, there are very
few reported biosensors for detecting histone acetylation. Sasaki
et al. from the Yoshida lab developed the first reported FRET-based
sensor of histone H4 hyperacetylation in 2009.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref776">776</xref></sup> This early sensor, named Histac, used Venus and CFP as
the FRET pair flanking a BRDT bromodomain, which binds acetylated
residues, a flexible linker, and full-length histone H4. Upon acetylation
of histone H4, the BRDT domain binds, leading to a conformational
change that increases in the cyan/yellow emission ratio. Histac was
validated in COS7 cells and used to identify changes in histone H4
acetylation during mitosis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref776">776</xref></sup> Histac was
later utilized by Dancy et al. to study the activity of the histone
acetyltransferase p300/CBP and identify inhibitors of the complex
in live cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref777">777</xref></sup> Sanchez and colleagues
later developed a reporter of histone H3 Lys 14 acetylation (H3K14ac)
that aimed to eliminate the use of model histones, as introduced by
the FRET-based H3K9me3 sensor, and instead detect endogenous histone
acetylation. The sensor incorporates tandem copies of the second bromodomain
of human poly bromodomain 1 (PB1) tagged to EGFP. H3K14ac is detected
by the presence of EGFP signal in the nuclei of transfected cells.
Because there is no direct intensity readout in this design, Sanchez
et al. proposed using their sensor to generate a spatially resolved
map of histone acetylation in live cells under varying conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref778">778</xref></sup> Another class of biosensors for detecting histone
modifications was introduced by the Kimura lab in 2013. In their approach,
Sato and colleagues used a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody,
which they called a modification-specific intracellular antibody,
or mintbody, fused to EGFP to detect H3K9 acetylation. This approach
allowed them to quantify the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio of EGFP
as a readout for changes in acetylation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref779">779</xref></sup> The scFV or mintbody-based approach was further expanded to detect
H4K20 methylation using another mintbody specific for that residue.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref774">774</xref></sup> Due to the dynamic nature of these modifications,
a biosensor that can achieve quantitative, time-resolved detection

ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator, was the first FP-based
cell cycle reporter. FUCCI is a bimolecular system which fuses mKO2,
an orange-emitting FP, to human Cdt1 (amino acids 30&#x02013;120) and,
separately, the green-emitting FP mAG1 to the first 110 residues of
human Geminin. Cdt1 accumulates in G1, and thus cells in G1 phase
are labeled orange as Cdt1 is expressed. As cells transition to S
phase, Cdt1, which is a substrate of the SCF<sup>Skp2</sup> E3 ligase,
is ubiquitinated and degraded. Cells in S/G2/M phases, on the other
hand, are labeled green due to Geminin expression, which is then targeted
for degradation by the APC<sup>Cdh1</sup> E3 ligase in G1 phase. The
transition from G1/S could be visualized by overlapping of red and
green fluorescence. The first version of FUCCI therefore reports on
G1 or S/G2/M phases and was used to characterize cell cycle states
during epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and wound healing in cultured
cells as well as in the developing neural tissue of FUCCI transgenic
mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref781">781</xref></sup></p><p>Several FUCCI variants have

capabilities of FUCCI by red-shifting the FP tags. FUCCI-Red was developed
as a single-color sensor. This version takes advantage of the distinct
fluorescence lifetimes of two red-emitting FPs, mCherry and mKate2,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref784">784</xref></sup> while utilizing the same sensing strategy as
FUCCI (<xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref></xref>a). The advantage of such a system is the
low spectral footprint, making it highly suitable for multiplexed
imaging applications. A red/far-red cell cycle indicator named NIR-FUCCI
was also developed using the same sensing strategy as FUCCI but switching
out the reporting units to smURFP and IFP2.0.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref180">180</xref></sup> The sensing system has also been tweaked to enable sensing
of different cellular states. Ki67<sub>p</sub>-FUCCI was developed
using a cell cycle-responsive Ki67 proximal promoter that enables
expression of the sensor only when cells enter the cell cycle, thereby
turning expression off in quiescent and nondividing cells. The sensing
components are like the original FUCCI, with Cdt1 and hGeminin tagged
to mCherry and mAG, respectively. Through this system, however, cells
in the quiescent (G0) state and slowly dividing cells are distinguishable.

CellMAPtracer was developed to track single-cell migration and cell
cycle phases and can uniquely allow correlation of cell cycle transitions
and migration status of single cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref795">795</xref></sup> Advancements in image analysis techniques are thus integral to expanding
applications of fluorescent biosensors and extracting greater information
from their use in the live-cell context.</p></sec><sec id="sec13.2"><label>13.2</label><title>Calcium Integrator Systems</title><p>In contrast
to real-time Ca<sup>2+</sup> biosensors (discussed in <xref rid="sec5.1" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec5.1" ref-type="other">5.1</xref></xref>), calcium integrators are
dual-gated and report on the combined history of increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and exogenous light exposure in individual cells
to provide an &#x0201c;activity snapshot&#x0201d; of cells in the greater
context of an organism or tissue (also discussed in <xref rid="sec5.1.4" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec5.1.4" ref-type="other">5.1.4</xref></xref>). One strategy to label
these cells with a history of high Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity is to
use photoconvertible FPs, as in the CaMPARI systems, discussed in <xref rid="sec5.1.4" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec5.1.4" ref-type="other">5.1.4</xref></xref>. The other
strategy, discussed here, uses the cell&#x02019;s transcriptional machinery
to do the labeling.</p><p>Roger Tsien first explored the concept of
a Ca<sup>2+</sup> memory dye in 2013 when he presented possible designs
for the integration of transcription and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels to transcriptionally label cells with a history of high Ca<sup>2+</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref796">796</xref></sup> Two integrator systems incorporating
the proposed light- and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-gated transcriptional system
to provide a snapshot of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in cells were published in
the same year: FLARE from the Ting group<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref797">797</xref></sup> and Cal-Light from the Kwon group.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref798">798</xref></sup> Although differing somewhat in their details, both integrator systems
are multicomponent designs that include a transcription factor or
activator fused to a TEV protease (TEVp) substrate peptide that has
a light-sensitive LOV domain blocking the cleavage site, a CaM binding
peptide, and a transmembrane helix for targeting to the plasma membrane.
The second component is CaM fused to a full-length TEV protease or
half of the TEV protease (with the other half incorporated into the
plasma membrane-targeted component). Light exposure causes the LOV
domain to reveal the TEVp cleavage site, while Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation
induces recruitment of TEVp to the TEVp site, or fragment complementation
of TEVp, via the interaction between Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM and the CaM-binding
peptide. Cleavage only occurs in the presence of both light and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, releasing the transcription factor to enter the nucleus
and induce target gene transcription. Importantly, the output of these
systems depends on the identity of the target gene. Transcription
of a simple FP reporter, for example, can be used to &#x0201c;permanently&#x0201d;
label cells that experienced Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations during illumination,
whereas transcription of a biochemical effector can allow precise
manipulation of a targeted cell population. This very approach was
demonstrated by driving the expression of an opsin to manipulate neuronal
function in FLARE-positive cells <italic>in vivo</italic> in the motor
cortex of mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref797">797</xref></sup> The Ting group later
developed FLiCRE, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> and light-gated integrator that
builds off the existing design of FLARE with some performance-improving
adjustments (<xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref></xref>b). This integrator was used to label cells in the nucleus accumbens
of mice <italic>in vivo</italic>. By performing single-cell RNA sequencing
on FLiCRE-labeled cells, the authors were able to identify distinct
cell types in the nucleus accumbens based on their responses to Ca<sup>2+</sup> excitatory conditions,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref786">786</xref></sup> enriching
our understanding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the mouse brain.
This versatile system has been extended to detect PPIs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref799">799</xref></sup> and cell&#x02013;cell contacts,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref800">800</xref></sup> and many more interesting applications are
on the horizon.</p></sec><sec id="sec13.3"><label>13.3</label><title>Complex Neurotransmitter Reporters</title><p>Neurotransmitters are crucial signaling molecules in the brain, and
monoamines like dopamine and norepinephrine are involved in key processes
ranging from memory formation to decision-making.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref801">801</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref802">802</xref></sup> However, the detection of neurotransmitter release <italic>in vivo</italic> has been hindered by the lack of methods with sufficient specificity
and adequate spatiotemporal resolution. In addition to the aforementioned
neurotransmitter biosensors (<xref rid="sec7" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec7" ref-type="other">7</xref></xref>), two other types of reporters have been developed.
Cell-based neurotransmitter fluorescent engineered reporters (CNiFERs)
have been developed for detecting dopamine, norepinephrine,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref787">787</xref></sup> and acetylcholine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref803">803</xref></sup> Briefly, CNiFERs are cells that stably express a specific GPCR that
selectively recognizes the neurotransmitter of interest together with
TN-XXL, a cyan-yellow FRET-based GECI that uses fragments of troponin
C as the sensing unit. Upon GPCR activation, endogenous G-proteins
trigger cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevation, which in turn induces
a FRET response from TN-XXL (<xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig14" ref-type="fig">14</xref></xref>c). CNiFERs were validated to detect neurotransmitter
release <italic>in vivo</italic> under 2P laser scanning microscopy
following implantation into the brains of adult mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref787">787</xref></sup></p><p>A similar system of detecting neurotransmitter
activity in live neurons was introduced by Lee and colleagues from
the Kwon lab, who developed the iTango system to identify dopamine
presence in neurons via expression of a marker gene following blue
light exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref804">804</xref></sup> Their trimolecular system
consists of DRD2 (dopamine receptor D2) fused to a truncated cryptochrome-interacting
domain (CIBN), a TEVp-cleavage sequence (TEVseq), a truncated light-responsive
AsLOV2 domain, and tTA transcription factor. Another component includes
the C-terminal TEVp fragment and cryptochrome 2 photolyase (CRYPHR).
The third component includes &#x003b2;-arrestin2 fused to the N-terminal
TEVp fragment. Upon blue light exposure and dopamine binding to DRD2,
&#x003b2;-arrestin2 is recruited to the receptor and CRY2PHR is recruited
to CIBN. The TEVseq region hiding within the AsLOV2 domain is exposed,
and reconstituted TEVp cleaves the exposed TEVseq, enabling the transcription
factor to translocate to the nucleus and induce expression of a marker
gene, in this case EGFP. Lee and colleagues were able to use this
system in live mice to label the dopamine-sensitive population of
neurons in the mouse brain. Furthermore, the subset of dopamine-sensitive
neurons involved in various behaviors were identified. Because reporters
like CNIFERs and the iTANGO system are coupled to GPCRs, their design
can be adapted to detect other molecules that signal via GPCRs, which
are highly relevant to the field of neuroscience and in many other
contexts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec14"><label>14</label><title>Conclusions and Outlook</title><p>Genetically
encoded fluorescent biosensors have exploded in recent
years in terms of both their utility and scope, from the number of
accessible biological targets to compatible imaging techniques. As
technologies like super-resolution microscopy and FLIM have become
more accessible to biological researchers, novel biosensors compatible
with these methods have been developed to take advantage of these
powerful techniques and reap the unique insights they can provide.
At the same time, the scope of accessible biological targets has greatly
expanded as new sensing domains for previously inaccessible targets
have been discovered or engineered, while the performance of sensors
for existing targets has continued to improve.</p><p>In this review,
we have discussed the different types of biosensors
generated to visualize numerous molecular targets, as well as improvements
to each biosensor class that are pushing the limits of what we can
illuminate and visualize in living cells. We discussed recent advancements
in FP engineering, where improved photophysics enable FP tags and
passive sensors to be used for super-resolution imaging of PPIs (<xref rid="sec2" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="other">2</xref></xref>). Alongside improvements
to fluorescent reporting units, developments in the engineered sensing
units of various biosensor types have yielded an impressive toolbox
of sensors for a myriad of analytes. A deeper understanding of the
fluorescence properties of FPs has resulted in environmental sensors,
such as temperature sensors, that can now report on minute variations
in intracellular temperatures with subcellular spatial resolution
(<xref rid="sec4" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="other">4</xref></xref>). As our
understanding of cellular processes has become more thorough, the
need for this kind of subcellular resolution in measuring enzymatic
activities (<xref rid="sec10" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec10" ref-type="other">10</xref></xref>) and analyte concentrations (<xref rid="sec5" ref-type="other">sections <xref rid="sec5" ref-type="other">5</xref></xref> and <xref rid="sec6" ref-type="other">6</xref>) has only grown,
revealing a complex portrait of interrelated pathways governing cellular
communication and homeostasis. A focus on spatial resolution, even
down to the molecular level, has enabled improvements in our understanding
of the dynamics of GPCR activation, internalization, and protein recruitment,
as novel biosensors and imaging technologies are developed in concert
with one another (<xref rid="sec8" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec8" ref-type="other">8</xref></xref>). In addition to increased spatial resolution, sensors have
recently been developed for historically intractable or difficult-to-detect
analytes, as new sensing units have been engineered and new scaffolds
developed, in particular for neurotransmitters like GABA and glutamate,
less commonly studied ions, and a number of metabolites, sure to broaden
our understanding of these analytes. Further understanding of these
analytes will drive future sensor development in turn. In addition,
novel imaging methods have been combined with specifically engineered
biosensors to enable absolute reporting of basal activity (<xref rid="sec10" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec10" ref-type="other">10</xref></xref>, <xref rid="sec11" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec11" ref-type="other">11</xref></xref>) or ion concentration (<xref rid="sec5" ref-type="other">section <xref rid="sec5" ref-type="other">5</xref></xref>), allowing more
quantitative readout of these critical components of cellular function.
These improvements in spatial and temporal precision, as well as in
analyte sensitivity and scope have cemented fluorescent biosensors
as invaluable tools for understanding the functions and biochemical
pathways of living cells. As new classes of sensors are developed,
we are able to learn more about the intricate connections underlying
the biology of the cell.</p><p>With the accelerating development of
new sensors, users should
take care to adopt lessons learned through the development and use
of previous biosensors. Sensors, especially for novel targets, should
be tested for selectivity for the target of interest to minimize confounding
responses produced by similar targets, as has been the case for some
sensors of divalent metal cations.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref359">359</xref></sup> Additionally,
inconvenient realities about the buffering extent of biosensors cannot
be ignored; many sensors, in high enough concentrations, have the
capability to buffer endogenous signals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref805">805</xref></sup> This effect may be particularly challenging <italic>in vivo</italic>, where the extent of buffering is often harder to determine due
to unknown sensor and analyte concentrations, while also affecting
downstream processes, including behavior, as has been reported with
buffering concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators resulting in
increased epileptiform events in transgenic mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref806">806</xref></sup> The affinity of a biosensor must be paid careful attention
not only for the purpose of avoiding buffering, but also for adapting
to the experiment at hand. Many sensors initially designed for detecting
signals in the cytosol or at the plasma membrane are not equally as
well-suited for reporting those signals in subcellular compartments,
either due to differences in local concentration,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref207">207</xref></sup> or in pH that affect the biosensor&#x02019;s signal or dynamic
range.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref529">529</xref></sup> Equally as important as carefully
selecting a sensor for the biological application of interest is to
select a biosensor that is compatible with the desired imaging modality
or system. Some biosensors that work well in immortalized cell lines
perform unexpectedly poorly <italic>in vivo</italic>,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref352">352</xref></sup> and still others are workhorses of intensity-based
imaging, but perform poorly when applied to techniques like FLIM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref201">201</xref></sup> With the development of more biosensors for
more targets, developers and users alike can take these lessons from
experience with previous sensors, and avoid pitfalls in sensor application
by carefully considering controls and ensuring sensors are carefully
developed and chosen for the applications they will ultimately be
used in.</p><p>Along with novel targets, the biosensors we have highlighted
in
this review have reflected a growth in the field toward increased
multiplexing. As new FPs have been discovered and optimized, especially
in the far-red to NIR region, the opportunities to multiplex readouts
of multiple signals have grown. The opportunities in this area are
far from exhausted, and we speculate that red and NIR FPs will continue
to be developed and optimized into biosensors in the coming years.
Particularly with the advent of synthetic RFPs like mScarlet, brighter
RFPs like the new mScarlet3<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> are likely
to be further developed and adapted into biosensor scaffolds, as most
red single-FP biosensors have so far been limited to cpmApple or cpmRuby-based
scaffolds. Additionally, BV-binding IR FPs are likely to receive more
engineering focus due to their utility for <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging. Current NIR biosensors are relatively dim, and many exhibit
an inverse response to the signal of interest. Both of these factors
are likely to be targets of further biosensor engineering in the coming
years. Alongside spectral multiplexing, another form of multiplexing
relying on fluorescence lifetime has seen more utility in recent years,
as exemplified with Fucci-Red,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref785">785</xref></sup> among
others.</p><p>Fluorescence lifetime imaging is just one example of
an imaging
technique harnessing the photophysical characteristics of FPs that
has seen increased use by biologists in recent years. FLIM, for instance,
has seen utility not just as an alternative multiplexing method, but
also as a quantitative readout of cellular signals. This focus on
quantitative optical microscopy has been driven by an improvement
in the understanding of how FP photophysics can be linked to the cellular
environment, and thus calibrated to readouts like fluorescence lifetime
and photochromism rates. An equal driver of these new imaging techniques,
however, has been the advancement of microscopy approaches and hardware
designs allowing the investigation of these photophysical properties.
Fluorescence lifetime in particular is becoming more accessible as
more commercial microscope companies begin to incorporate it into
out-of-the-box systems, available to more and more users, as well
as the development of new FLIM hardware that allows for faster imaging
than traditional FLIM systems, such as electro-optical FLIM.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref807">807</xref></sup> As previously limited technology becomes widely
available in microscopy core facilities and even individual laboratories,
the drive to develop sensors that leverage these technologies will
continue. Like fluorescence lifetime, this trend is beginning with
some super-resolution microscopes. While super-resolution-compatible
biosensors are so far still limited, we believe the next several years
will bring in more developments, along with the continuing advances
in FLIM-compatible sensors and other quantitative imaging methods,
allowing increased spatial resolution and improved quantitative readouts
for biosensor measurements. As these sensors are optimized and applied
with new imaging technologies, the intertwined fields of biosensor
(software) and microscope technology (hardware) development will push
each other to new heights in the coming decade and continue to produce
exciting new opportunities in the biosensor development and cellular
signaling fields.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="" id="notes2"><title>Author Present Address</title><p><sup>#</sup> Division
