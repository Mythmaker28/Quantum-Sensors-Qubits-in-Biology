  Fluorescent protein (FP) biosensors are critical tools in applied photonics, enabling real-time monitoring of cellular dynamics through optical contrast measurements. However, the field lacks a centralized, quality-controlled dataset of measured contrast values with traceable provenance. We present the Biological Qubits Atlas v1.2.1, an open dataset of 66 FP variants and biosensors across 7 protein families, including 54 systems with measured optical contrast (ΔF/F₀, fold-change, or percent change). All data are sourced from Open Access literature (CC-BY/CC0) with full DOI/PMCID traceability. The dataset includes calcium sensors (GCaMP6/7/8, R-GECO, RCaMP), dopamine sensors (dLight, GRAB-DA), glutamate sensors (iGluSnFR), voltage sensors (ASAP3, ArcLight), and pH/metabolic indicators. Each entry includes optical properties (excitation/emission wavelengths, quantum yield), experimental context, and quality tiers (A: with confidence intervals; B: measured; C: computed). The Atlas enables machine learning applications, biosensor selection, and meta-analyses in biophysics. Data are available via GitHub (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.XXXXXX) with SHA256 checksums for reproducibility.

# Introduction

Fluorescent protein (FP) biosensors have revolutionized cell biology and neuroscience by enabling non-invasive, real-time monitoring of cellular dynamics^1,2^. These genetically encoded indicators exploit conformational changes upon analyte binding to modulate fluorescence intensity, yielding measurable optical contrast. Key applications span calcium imaging (GCaMP^3^, jGCaMP^4^), neurotransmitter detection (dLight^5^, iGluSnFR^6^), and voltage sensing (ASAP^7^, ArcLight^8^).

Despite extensive literature on FP biosensors, the field lacks a centralized, quality-controlled dataset of measured contrast values with traceable provenance. Existing resources (FPbase^9^, Addgene) provide protein sequences and spectral properties but rarely include standardized contrast measurements under controlled conditions. This gap hinders:

1. **Quantitative biosensor selection**: Researchers lack objective metrics to compare sensor performance.
2. **Machine learning applications**: Predictive models (e.g., contrast-from-sequence) require large, clean training datasets.
3. **Meta-analyses**: Systematic reviews are impeded by heterogeneous reporting standards.

To address these challenges, we developed the **Biological Qubits Atlas**, an open, curated dataset of FP biosensors with measured optical contrast. Version 1.2.1 (December 2024) consolidates 66 FP variants and biosensors, including 54 systems with experimentally measured contrast values extracted from peer-reviewed, Open Access literature.

## Dataset Scope and Principles

The Atlas focuses on:

- **Fluorescent protein biosensors**: GCaMP (calcium), dLight/GRAB-DA (dopamine), iGluSnFR (glutamate), ASAP/ArcLight (voltage), pHluorin/HyPer (pH/redox).
- **Standard FP variants**: EGFP, mCherry, mScarlet, mNeonGreen (reference proteins).
- **Measured optical contrast**: ΔF/F₀ (delta-F-over-F₀), fold-change (F_max/F_min), or percent change, with experimental context (temperature, pH, host system).
- **Open Access sources only**: All data sourced from CC-BY or CC0 literature (PubMed Central, UniProt, PDB) with full DOI/PMCID traceability.
- **No synthetic data**: All values are real measurements; missing data left as NULL.

# Methods

## Data Sources and Harvesting

### Primary Sources

1. **FPbase** (fpbase.org)^9^: Protein names, families, spectral properties (excitation/emission maxima, quantum yield, extinction coefficient). License: CC BY-SA 4.0 (pointer-only; no bulk text copying).

2. **UniProt** (uniprot.org): Canonical protein IDs, sequences, organism information. License: CC BY 4.0.

3. **Protein Data Bank (PDB/PDBe)** (ebi.ac.uk/pdbe): Structural data (PDB IDs), experimental methods. License: CC0.

4. **Europe PubMed Central (PMC)**: Full-text Open Access articles for contrast measurements. License: per-article (CC-BY or CC0).

### Harvesting Pipeline

Data extraction followed a multi-stage pipeline:

1. **Seed collection**: Manual curation of 66 known FP/biosensor names from landmark publications (Chen et al. 2013^3^, Dana et al. 2021^4^, Patriarchi et al. 2018^5^).

2. **Cross-referencing**: Query UniProt and PDB APIs for each protein to retrieve IDs, sequences, and structural data.

3. **Contrast extraction**: Search Europe PMC for each protein + keywords ("ΔF/F₀", "fold change", "response", "dynamic range"). Extract numerical values from Open Access full-text (XML parsing) or supplementary tables.

4. **Manual curation**: For high-priority biosensors (GCaMP6/7/8, dLight, iGluSnFR), manually extract contrast values from original publications, including:
   - Contrast value and unit (fold, ΔF/F₀, %)
   - Sample size (n), standard deviation (SD), confidence intervals (CI)
   - Experimental context (cell type, analyte concentration, temperature, pH)
   - Figure/table reference, DOI/PMCID

### Data Schema

Each entry contains:

- **Identification**: SystemID, protein_name, variant, family (GFP-like, Calcium, Dopamine, etc.), is_biosensor (0/1)
- **Optical properties**: excitation_nm, emission_nm, quantum_yield, extinction_coef, brightness_relative
- **Contrast**: contrast_ratio (measured value), contrast_unit (fold/deltaF_F0/percent), contrast_normalized (fold-change), contrast_source (measured/computed), n, SD, CI_low, CI_high
- **Provenance**: doi, pmcid, figure_ref, source_refs, license_source
- **Context**: condition_text (temperature, pH, host, assay details)

### Quality Tiers

Contrast measurements are classified into three quality tiers:

- **Tier A**: Measured with confidence intervals or sample size (n ≥ 3)
- **Tier B**: Measured without statistical information
- **Tier C**: Computed (e.g., from quantum yield × extinction coefficient) or missing

## Data Normalization

To enable cross-study comparisons, all contrast values were normalized to fold-change:

- **Fold-change** → fold (unchanged)
- **ΔF/F₀** → fold = ΔF/F₀ + 1
- **Percent change** → fold = 1 + (percent / 100)

Original units and values are preserved in separate columns.

## Quality Assurance

### Blocking Thresholds

The dataset passed strict quality gates:

- **N_total ≥ 50**: Total FP/biosensor systems
- **N_measured ≥ 25**: Systems with measured contrast
- **families_with_≥3 ≥ 6**: Protein families represented by ≥3 measured systems each

### License Compliance

# Discussion

## Impact and Applications

The Biological Qubits Atlas addresses a critical gap in applied photonics by providing the first open, quality-controlled dataset of FP biosensor contrast measurements. Key applications include:

1. **Biosensor Selection**: Researchers can objectively compare sensor performance for specific analytes (e.g., calcium vs. dopamine) using standardized metrics.

2. **Machine Learning**: The dataset enables training of predictive models (e.g., contrast from protein sequence/structure), analogous to AlphaFold for structure prediction.

3. **Meta-Analyses**: Systematic reviews of biosensor development trends, performance evolution, and design principles.

4. **Standardization**: The quality tier system (A/B/C) provides a framework for reporting standards in future publications.

## Limitations

1. **Coverage**: Current version (v1.2.1) focuses on well-characterized biosensors; many recent sensors (post-2023) not yet included.

2. **Context Variability**: Contrast values depend on experimental conditions (cell type, imaging setup, analyte concentration). The Atlas reports "typical" values from original publications.

3. **Bias Toward Calcium Sensors**: GCaMP dominance (18/66 systems) reflects publication volume; other modalities underrepresented.

4. **API Dependencies**: Harvesting relies on external APIs (FPbase, UniProt, PMC) which may experience downtime (as observed during v1.3 development).

## Future Directions

Version 1.3 (planned Q1 2025) will:

- **Expand to 200+ systems** via full-text PMC mining and supplementary file parsing
- **Add >10 protein families** (acetylcholine, serotonin, norepinephrine sensors)
- **Implement community contributions** ("Biosensor Commons") for user-submitted data
- **Integrate spectral data** (full excitation/emission spectra, not just maxima)

Long-term, the Atlas aims to become a community-driven resource, analogous to UniProt for FP biosensors.

# Conclusions

The Biological Qubits Atlas v1.2.1 provides a foundational dataset for applied photonics research, consolidating 66 FP biosensors with 54 measured optical contrast values. All data are openly licensed (CC-BY/CC0), fully traceable (DOI/PMCID), and quality-tiered (A/B/C). The dataset enables quantitative biosensor selection, machine learning applications, and meta-analyses, addressing a longstanding gap in the field. We invite the community to utilize, extend, and contribute to this resource.
